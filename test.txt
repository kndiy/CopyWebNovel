Chapter 751: Mischief
Translator: CKtalon
After a long silence, the honest Shang Jianyao finally couldn’t help but ask, “Why are we staying in here and guarding Room 102 without entering?”
The rash Shang Jianyao tugged at the collar of his grayish-green camouflage uniform. “Who says we aren’t going in? You’re the ones stopping me!
“After clearing Master Zhuang’s dream or a psychological trauma, we can become an Awakened who has explored the Mind Corridor’s depths. When the time comes, we might directly discover the door to the New World inside!”
During the time they took to return to Pangu Biology from Tai City, the Shang Jianyaos were affected by the adventurous one and the one who sought fun again without Jiang Baimian’s urging. They chose a room that didn’t have a detailed ‘strategy guide.’ This resulted in them only clearing the second psychological trauma recently.
In other words, he had to incompletely explore another room before he could be considered an Awakened deep in the Mind Corridor and be qualified to search for the New World’s door.
“Don’t drag us down even if you have a death wish.” The cold Shang Jianyao sat cross-legged on the ground and stared at 102’s vermilion door without blinking.
At this moment, the calm and rational Shang Jianyao stretched and straightened his legs from leaning against the wall. He smiled and said, “I come over every day to see when Room 102 will move. What are you guys doing here?”
102 was originally not beside his Mind Room. It was only when the Old Task Force encountered Master Zhuang’s dream in Tai City that the room suddenly appeared in its current location.
Jiang Baimian originally imagined that with Master Zhuang awakening and her team leaving Tai City, Room 102 would quickly move elsewhere. However, she never expected that even after they returned to Pangu Biology in late autumn, Room 102 remained fixed.
This Shang Jianyao’s answer made his peers fall silent.
After a few seconds, the honest Shang Jianyao voiced his thoughts. “I want to see what illness you’ve contracted.”
“I thought you were planning on supporting me in clearing Master Zhuang’s psychological trauma or dream.” The rash Shang Jianyao found it a pity.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao smiled and said, “It’s better to find a simpler room and quickly upgrade ourselves to the Mind Corridor’s depths. We can consider 102 when we have Yama Tiger’s strength from back then.”
“Alright.” The cold and sinister Shang Jianyao agreed.
The ten of them combined and turned in the direction they hadn’t explored.
After walking along the thick, dark-yellow carpet for a while, Shang Jianyao’s eyes suddenly lit up as he swept his gaze across the area. He saw a familiar door number: 506!
According to the strategy guide, this room’s psychological trauma had a fixed solution—face the danger directly with courage. Therefore, exploring it was relatively safe and simple.
In other words, Shang Jianyao could become an Awakened in the Mind Corridor’s depths in a few days.
After considering for a few seconds, the rash Shang Jianyao and the Shang Jianyao that sought novelty voted in favor of the calm and rational Shang Jianyao’s suggestion to explore Room 506 in order to enter Room 102.
After an argument, Shang Jianyao turned the brass handle and pushed open the door to Room 506.
As this room was universally acknowledged to be simple, he didn’t even bring the Six Senses Beads or the Life Angel necklace.
After taking two steps forward, a dark sea suddenly appeared in front of Shang Jianyao.
He was on an island surrounded by an endless sea in the dim night.
Violent winds howled as they swept past. From time to time, they would stir up mountain-like waves, making humans appear abnormally insignificant under the mighty force of nature.
Huzzah! Huzzah!
Large waves constantly slammed the edge of the island, making Shang Jianyao feel like he was experiencing an endless earthquake.
Suddenly, a black figure appeared from the dark water.
The black figure was massive like another island, but it was hidden at the bottom of the sea.
The black figure vaguely moved.
Shang Jianyao remembered the ‘clearing strategy’ and muttered to himself, “Face the danger directly with courage… Face the danger directly with courage…”
As he muttered to himself, slippery tentacles covered in eyeballs had appeared at some point in time at the edge of the island.
The black and white eyes quickly darted around as they looked at Shang Jianyao.
“Face the danger directly with courage!” Shang Jianyao—who was being stared at—smiled excitedly. The next second, heads drilled out of his head, shoulders, chest, lower abdomen, and limbs.
Long arms and pairs of legs grew out as well.
The ten Shang Jianyaos appeared on the tottering island in this way. They then rolled, walked, and ran toward the tentacles that were covered in eyeballs, rushing at the gigantic black figure hiding under the boundless sea.
“The hymn of humanity is the hymn of courage!” Shang Jianyao shouted as he rushed forward.
The eyes on the slippery tentacles froze for a second before they screamed in unison, “Don’t come over!”
1
The tentacles suddenly retracted into the sea, but the Shang Jianyaos had no intention of stopping.
At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky suddenly split.
The entire world quickly shattered as it shook violently.
…
Tarnan, Serene Dream Hotel.
The lady boss—Aynor—sat up trembling while hugging her blanket.
That scared me to death! Why did I have such a terrifying dream!? She quickly switched on the lights.
As the white light ruled over the bedroom and dispersed all the darkness, Aynor heaved a sigh of relief, but she didn’t dare to attempt to sleep.
…
“Does this count as clearing it?” The Shang Jianyaos combined again and muttered to themselves in confusion.
He didn’t sense any improvement in his mind and abilities.
After he looked up again and examined his surroundings, he realized that he was in a relatively strange place.
The decorations here were similar to the C-14 project team he had been to. The metal walls separated complicated equipment.
The humans coming and going wore white coats and light-blue masks.
“It was only a dream previously, but it’s a psychological trauma now?” Shang Jianyao stroked his chin.
His expression gradually became excited.
Such scenes always reminded him of the term ‘research institute.’
Shang Jianyao was just about to delve deeper into this psychological trauma when he suddenly recalled something and flipped his wrist to look at his watch.
“It’s almost 8!” he exclaimed.
The Shang Jianyaos then unanimously agreed to end this exploration.
…
In the real world, Shang Jianyao—who was lying in bed—opened his eyes. He sat up a little and placed the pillow behind him.
Shang Jianyao had just adjusted his posture when the radio outside the window sounded. A familiar, slightly childlike voice sounded in his ears. “Good evening, everyone. I’m Newspoint broadcaster, Hou Yi. It’s 8 p.m. now…
“The Board of Directors convened a meeting today to discuss the production assignments for the last quarter of this year. The Board of Directors and Vice President Ji Ze pointed out that the company’s overall situation in the first three quarters was stable and developing in a moderate and good way. They requested that everyone not relax or slack in the last quarter…
“The Board of Directors also discussed the scale of the end-of-year bonuses and next year’s labor insurance and related benefits…
“In order to liven up the atmosphere in the last quarter of this year and better the employees’ emotional states, the Entertainment Department has decided to hold the Spring Welcoming Singing Competition in the coming days. The top three in the competition will have a chance to appear on the stage for the end-of-year performance…”
Shang Jianyao’s eyes lit up as he seriously considered which song he would sing this time. He was so focused that he didn’t listen to the subsequent news.
He fell asleep at some point in time.
In the middle of the night, Shang Jianyao—who had slept in the afternoon—woke up. He suddenly sat up, draped himself in a thick, military-green cotton coat, picked up the thick, black plastic flashlight, and walked out of the room.
After relieving himself in the public bathroom, Shang Jianyao flipped his wrist to look at his watch and quietly walked in the opposite direction of home.
He arrived at Zone C, Room 11—outside Long Yuehong’s house. He then squatted at the base of the wall opposite Room 11 and placed the flashlight under his chin, prepared to turn it on at any moment.
“You want to scare Little Red?” the honest Shang Jianyao asked his peer in a low voice.
The Shang Jianyao that liked to joke chuckled and said, “Otherwise?”
“But how do you know that he would go to the bathroom at this time?” The honest Shang Jianyao expressed his confusion.
Even people with the habit of getting up at night wouldn’t go to the public bathroom at the same time every night. Furthermore, Long Yuehong’s house had a small bathroom!
The Shang Jianyao that liked to joke and pull pranks replied calmly, “When you were suppressed by them in the morning, I took the opportunity to control the body and implanted the thought of ‘go to the public bathroom at three in the morning to relieve himself’ in Little Red.”
“But how can you be sure that you will wake up at three in the morning?” the honest Shang Jianyao asked.
He didn’t notice any implanted thoughts in himself.
The mischievous Shang Jianyao shook his head. “I can’t be sure. If I don’t wake up, I’ll treat it as helping Little Red train his courage.”
Just as he said that, he suddenly exclaimed, “There are only three human consciousnesses in the room… Little Red isn’t here!”
Apart from Long Zhigu—who was studying in university and staying on the corresponding floor—the Long family of five should have four human consciousnesses. Furthermore, as a regular visitor to the Long family, Shang Jianyao knew which room Long Yuehong was in and confirmed that there was nobody inside.
The honest Shang Jianyao laughed. “Got it. Little Red went to sleep at Little White’s!”
“Lame,” muttered the Shang Jianyao that liked to joke. He stood up and returned to Zone B.
…
622nd floor, Zone B, Room 59.
Long Yuehong—who had woken up due to his need to pee—carefully removed Bai Chen’s hand and leg from his body and crawled out of the warm blanket.
He didn’t bring a thick cotton coat with him, so he could only make do with Bai Chen’s to resist the cold in the room and in the corridor.
After wrapping himself in a thick coat, Long Yuehong took a key and left the room with a flashlight.
He didn’t forget to close the door. Then, in the cold and dark aisle, he walked toward the public bathroom with the yellow beam of light guiding the way.
At three in the morning, the corridor was silent.

Chapter 752: Familiar Night
Translator: CKtalon
Although Long Yuehong had experienced such situations time and time again since his first memory, humanity’s fear of the darkness and the unknown never disappeared. Unless one had mental problems, even the boldest person couldn’t help but feel a little scared when walking alone in the quiet, late-night corridor.
As the flashlight swept across the area, Long Yuehong recalled Shang Jianyao saying: Sing to yourself if you are afraid while walking alone at night!
Previously, he had scoffed at this. After all, he had lived on that floor for 23 years. Even if he discounted the little bit of childhood memories, he had nearly 20 years of familiarity with the corresponding environment. He wouldn’t take the wrong path with his eyes closed.
In such a situation, the fear wouldn’t be too serious. It could be completely overcome.
But now, on the unfamiliar 622nd floor, the darkness always ruled over the corresponding area after his flashlight beam moved away. It made him involuntarily feel a chill.
No matter how terrifying it is, can it be more terrifying than the nights in those city ruins? Long Yuehong muttered to himself silently as his courage seemed to return. His strides became wider, and his pace became faster.
As for the idea of boosting his courage by singing, he ultimately didn’t use it. Wouldn’t it be disturbing someone’s sleep on such a quiet night?
Thanks to the similar layout of the residential floors and the need to consider the layout of the sewage pipes, as well as Long Yuehong using the bathroom on this floor before lights out, it didn’t take him long to reach his destination.
This was the public bathroom at the intersection of Zone B and Zone C.
In the men’s bathroom, the dim yellow light swayed in the cold, gloomy night wind. It was dim and indistinct, reminding Long Yuehong of the ghost films in the Old World’s entertainment.
This thought flashed through his mind. With his 20 years of rich experience, he determined that someone had switched on a flashlight while squatting in the bathroom.
Don’t you know how to conserve energy!? Long Yuehong—who was a D7 employee—remained thrifty in this regard.
The energy allocation quota in Pangu Biology was only determined based on one’s rank and position. It couldn’t be bought with contribution points even if one wanted to!
Of course, this was only on the public level. In private, there were people who allowed others to use electricity at their home as long as the price was right.
Long Yuehong retracted his gaze and walked to a small urinal to relieve himself. In order not to have splashback, he also didn’t turn off the flashlight and lodged it on the back of his hand—on the back of the T1 mechanical arm.
After doing the shake and zipping up, Long Yuehong subconsciously looked at the spot where the yellowish light was swaying.
Suddenly, his gaze froze slightly.
He saw a faint plume of smoke fill the yellowishness. It sometimes swelled and sometimes tumbled as if it had a life of its own.
As Long Yuehong frowned slightly, he vaguely heard a suppressed groan. This groan sounded faint as if it were restraining some kind of pain.
Long Yuehong’s mind became extremely clear. His first reaction was to leave the public bathroom and formulate a plan. However, he then realized that this was the company. If anything really happened, everyone would be affected, and he couldn’t retreat.
Confirm the situation first. If something goes wrong, quickly report it to the Order Supervisory Department… Long Yuehong quickly made a decision. He switched off his flashlight and walked to the cubicle.
The closer he approached, the more obvious the smoke became. The groans that carried some kind of pain became clearer.
Upon seeing his target at hand, Long Yuehong jumped over.
The next second, he exchanged looks with the man squatting in the cubicle.
After a brief pause, the man turned anxious and angry. “What are you looking at?”
Long Yuehong’s mouth quivered. “Why didn’t you close the door?”
The man held a cigarette in one hand and held the door with the other. He laughed in anger. “It’s late at night, and there’s nobody. What’s wrong with me opening the door to get some air?”
Long Yuehong composed himself. “Where did you get the cigarettes from?”
Within Pangu Biology, apart from most of the deceased older generation and a few people who got hooked, the other employees didn’t smoke. Therefore, Long Yuehong didn’t think in that direction.
This was a luxury good in a sense.
If not for the fact that his stomach hadn’t been cleared out and that his butt hadn’t been wiped, the man squatting there would’ve jumped up and beaten Long Yuehong up.
He snapped, “I exchanged it from a settlement in the Blackmarsh Wilderness when I was outfield! What’s wrong? I’m an employee who just joined. It’s normal for me to be addicted to cigarettes!”
As he swept his gaze, his pupils suddenly dilated, reflecting Long Yuehong’s iron-black arm.
Long Yuehong saw the other party clearly; he had relatively dark skin, and he had a mouthful of yellow teeth. His face was pockmarked, and his eyes were clearly bloodshot. It was obvious that he was a foreign employee who hadn’t undergone genetic enhancement. It could only be said that he wasn’t ugly or terrifying.
Despite the embarrassment, Long Yuehong still asked, “Then, why did you groan just now?”
“Can’t I be constipated, Bro?” The man’s attitude became rather good.
Long Yuehong laughed dryly. “I just came back from the field, and I’m still quite tense. I overreacted a little. Sorry.”
“Understood, understood.” The man looked very amiable. He paused and said, “Can—can you not stand in front of me like this? Uh—no, can I close the door?”
“Sure, sure.” Long Yuehong was especially grateful that the light was dim and couldn’t illuminate his face.
Just as he said that, the cubicle door swung back to a close.
The man inside fell silent for a few seconds before asking, “Which company are you from? Where did you get the mechanical arm?”
“I’m from a special operations team.” Due to confidentiality, Long Yuehong could only give a vague answer. He then curiously asked, “Why are you concerned about a mechanical arm?”
The man in the cubicle sighed and said, “I’m a foreign employee, and I’m not qualified to undergo genetic enhancement. I also have to go out on missions on the surface often. In order to survive—to survive until an internal transfer can be carried out—it’s very worth it to exchange an arm for a mechanical arm.”
Long Yuehong thought for a moment and sincerely said, “It’s very expensive.”
“Sigh…” The man in the cubicle sighed again.
Long Yuehong didn’t tell him that he could perform a biological prosthetic limb transplant for free if he lost his arm during the mission. There were just no options to choose from. Furthermore, it was impossible for him to obtain those with good abilities. This was because losing an arm meant excessive blood loss. The probability of not being resuscitated was significant, especially when he was on the surface and couldn’t be treated in time.
He turned around and walked out of the public bathroom.
With this comparison, he suddenly felt that his current situation was pretty good.
It’s even better if I don’t have to go out on missions again… As Long Yuehong thought, he casually shone the flashlight around. He saw many graffiti-covered walls drawn with chalk. Some were deep, some were childish, and some were exaggerated. They were all unique.
This was identical to the scene in many places on the 495th floor. It was the same for the other residential floors.
For some reason, Long Yuehong was inexplicably happy.
This was a sign that foreign employees had begun to integrate into the company, and it was also a symbol that their descendants were being born.
At the thought of this, he returned to Zone B’s Room 59 with a faster gait.
After taking three to four steps, Long Yuehong stopped and turned his ear. He seemed to have heard something.
After listening carefully, he didn’t discover anything apart from snoring.
As expected, I haven’t completely relaxed… Long Yuehong shook his head in self-deprecation and walked toward Zone B, Room 59.
…
The next morning, Room 14 on the 647th floor.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen walked hand in hand and realized that Shang Jianyao was alone in the office.
He sat with a pompous posture, leaning back in his chair to its limits with his feet on the table.
Long Yuehong released Bai Chen’s hand and subconsciously asked, “Where’s Team Leader?”
Shang Jianyao replied with a bright smile, “Guess.”
Lost again? Long Yuehong wanted to answer, but he suddenly felt a chill at the back of his neck and jolted awake.
If Team Leader were loitering in the corridor and heard me bad-mouthing her behind her back, things would be troublesome! Her hearing is different from before! Long Yuehong suddenly looked back and didn’t discover anyone passing by outside.
But from the corner of his eye, he saw Bai Chen secretly retract her hand from the back of his neck.
Long Yuehong looked over and saw the corners of Bai Chen’s mouth curl up slightly with a serious expression.
He also smiled.
“Woof, woof, woof!” Shang Jianyao barked.
Long Yuehong was feeling a little embarrassed when the phone in the office rang.
“Quick, pick it up,” he quickly said to Shang Jianyao.
Shang Jianyao had a nonchalant expression. “They must be looking for Big White. She’s not around, so picking it up will require us to come up with a reason for her. It’s better not to pick it up.”
“That’s true.” Long Yuehong thought for a moment and felt that it made sense.
Bai Chen didn’t object.
The ringing stopped after a while.
After about ten minutes, Jiang Baimian walked into the office. She didn’t explain anything and greeted her team members with a normal expression.
Not long after Jiang Baimian sat down, the telephone rang again.
She picked up the receiver and brought it to her ear. After listening for a while, she tersely made a few acknowledgments before turning to Shang Jianyao and shouting, “Hey, it’s for you!”

Chapter 753: “Casual Chat”
Translator: CKtalon
Shang Jianyao jumped up and shouted into the receiver from afar, “Why— Are— You— Looking— For— Me?”
He enunciated each word clearly. When he reached the last word, he had already run to Jiang Baimian’s side and taken the receiver.
The entire process was smooth and natural. It perfectly showcased his coordination, balance, running speed, and timing.
Jiang Baimian was first stunned before she understood and mouthed to Shang Jianyao, “Do you need me to add some special effects?”
This fellow was mimicking a scene from an Old World drama serial.
As Shang Jianyao smiled at her, he spoke to the person on the other end of the line.
After a few sentences, he put down the receiver and said in high spirits, “Director Su is looking for me.”
Director Su Yu was in charge of the Security Department.
“Why is Director Su looking for you?” Long Yuehong asked in confusion.
Shang Jianyao shook his head. “I don’t know either.”
Jiang Baimian deliberated for a few seconds and guessed, “You’ve already come clean that you are an Awakened. The price you paid is mental problems, so the C-14 project team’s tests and the psychiatrist’s evaluations will become unnecessary. The observation will probably be directly handed over to Director Su—who is also an Awakened and a board member.”
Professional matters were left to the professionals.
Shang Jianyao was stunned for a moment before he shouted, “No!”
“Why?” Bai Chen didn’t understand this fellow’s reaction.
Shang Jianyao had a disappointed expression. “It’s quite comfortable chatting with Dr. Lin. The canteen exclusive to the C-14 project team also has very delicious food.”
Jiang Baimian held in her laughter and said, “I can only say that I’m sorry for your loss.”
Shang Jianyao fell silent for a while before letting out a long sigh. “One has to know how to look forward. I wonder how the food at the board’s exclusive canteen is…”
At this point, his eyes lit up again, and he looked eager.
…
Underground building, fifth floor, Management Zone.
Shang Jianyao met Director Su Yu in Room 506.
Su Yu stood around the sofas and pointed opposite him. He smiled and said, “Come over and have a seat.”
At this moment, the guards in bionic artificial intelligence armor had yet to leave the room.
Shang Jianyao looked at the office area with a large wooden table and a black high-back chair and asked Su Yu in confusion, “Director Su, why don’t we talk over there? You can sit where you are, and I’ll just sit opposite the table. That seems more formal.”
Before Su Yu—who was wearing a gray combat uniform—could answer, the honest Shang Jianyao continued, “This is to show politeness.”
Su Yu—who was in his forties—blushed and coughed. “We’re just having a casual chat, not business. Have a seat. Have a seat.”
His thick eyebrows, large eyes, and square face—which was covered in pockmarks due to the elements—instantly returned to normal.
After the guards left the room, Shang Jianyao sat on the long sofa opposite him.
Su Yu smiled and said, “I’ve already read the report submitted by Old Jiang’s daughter. I want to hear you say it again—from your perspective.”
Shang Jianyao assumed a posture. “That’s a long story.”
Su Yu habitually wanted to say, “It’s fine; feel free to tell me.” However, he remembered this fellow’s usual behavior and suppressed that thought. He only smiled and didn’t say a word.
Shang Jianyao waited for a while before sighing regretfully. He then seriously recounted the Old Task Force’s experience from the steelworks factory ruins to Tai City.
Without a doubt, he depicted the version that Jiang Baimian had reviewed. The only difference was him emphasizing the small jade Buddha’s role.
This was rarely reflected in the telegram’s content in the past, but the report Jiang Baimian submitted also mentioned that the Old Task Force had only truly confirmed that the item obtained from the steelworks factory ruins was sufficiently special after the incident in Tai City.
As Su Yu listened, he nodded from time to time and said, “With that jade Buddha and the Six Senses Beads, you can discover the New World node even without the Life Angel necklace.”
At this point, he praised, “You guys found a way to deal with a New World node the first time you encountered one—by flushing it with high-intensity electric currents. Both your abilities and brains are indeed outstanding.”
Shang Jianyao became modest on Jiang Baimian’s behalf. “It’s just luck.”
Su Yu thought for a moment before asking, “Apart from that, what changes have you undergone?”
Shang Jianyao instantly revealed an ‘I won’t be sleepy if we talk about this’ expression. “When I encountered Master Zhuang’s dream in Tai City’s No. 1 Senior High School, I tried to sleep at the school entrance to observe the changes that would happen around my Mind Room.”
“What did you discover?” Su Yu’s expression unconsciously turned solemn.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “A room appeared out of thin air—102!”
“102…” Su Yu’s pupils slightly dilated as he muttered to himself. After a few seconds, he let out a long sigh. “So Room 102 corresponds to the Kalendaria, Master Zhuang. Apart from Yama Tiger, an Awakened from the company also entered this room and went completely crazy.”
As he spoke, he picked up the porcelain cup and took a large gulp.
Shang Jianyao curiously asked, “How can you be sure that the person also entered 102?”
“Every Mind Corridor-level Awakened in the company will report the door number they plan on exploring to the Board of Directors before the exploration of a new room. This way, there’s still a chance of being rescued,” Su Yu replied calmly.
Smack!
Shang Jianyao slapped his thigh. “I didn’t report mine!”
Su Yu was stunned for a moment before asking, “You entered a new room, a room that wasn’t given in the information? Before exploring the Mind Corridor’s depths, just follow the instructions given in the information and clear the psychological traumas step by step!”
As for seeking their own door that led to the New World later, that was a relatively private matter. However, nobody would easily attempt an unfamiliar destination unless they couldn’t find anything in the rooms mentioned in the information.
This was also the reason why he didn’t warn Shang Jianyao previously. Who would abandon the easy for the difficult?
Su Yu couldn’t help but wonder if he had underestimated Shang Jianyao’s mental illness.
Perhaps he isn’t just suffering from a split personality. There are other problems, or perhaps the split personalities like to go to extremes? Su Yu quickly speculated the reason.
Shang Jianyao nodded without hesitation. “That’s right.”
He raised his finger and counted them one by one. “522, 912…”
Su Yu listened in silence and asked with a frown, “You didn’t explore 102, right?”
“I’m not stupid!” Shang Jianyao replied truthfully.
This made Su Yu feel that he appeared relatively stupid for asking this question.
He organized his words and said, “Write up the general situation of those rooms later and submit it to me. Consider this a contribution. There’s a corresponding reward. Don’t worry; it’s definitely generous.”
Shang Jianyao didn’t hide his excitement. “Sure, sure!”
Su Yu took a deep breath and said, “You should’ve opened 102’s door and looked inside. What exactly did you see?”
Shang Jianyao didn’t hide anything and simply described it. “The dream in Tai City’s No. 1 Senior High School and a scene suspected to be the entrance of Linhe Village in Dajiang City…”
Su Yu listened very attentively. After discussing this matter, he asked in concern, “Are you alright?”
Shang Jianyao nodded. “We’re all fine.”
Su Yu wasn’t surprised and tersely acknowledged it. “Actually, the severity of your price will slowly deepen before you enter the New World; it won’t be too exaggerated. It’s the same even when you explore the Mind Corridor’s depths.”
Upon mentioning the power node deep in the Mind Corridor, Su Yu took the opportunity to ask, “How many rooms are you missing?”
Shang Jianyao assumed a posture of recalling and calculating. “In theory, one more.”
He was definitely honest.
“Not bad.” Su Yu nodded slightly. “It seems like you gained a lot from exploring new rooms.”
“It was alright,” Shang Jianyao replied humbly.
Su Yu reminded him, “Once you reach deep in the Mind Corridor, there are two major changes: The first is that you can separate your aura and create items yourself.
“The second is that if you grasp a certain person’s mind coordinates, you can open the corresponding passage and descend directly. This will also allow the chaos in your Sea of Origins to be restrained to a certain extent.
“There’s no qualitative improvement in strength.”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped for Director Su.
Su Yu’s eyebrows twitched slightly as he said, “Any questions?”
Shang Jianyao thought for a moment and asked seriously, “Director Su, why don’t you organize Mind Corridor-level Awakened to hold regular gatherings to exchange thoughts, sing, and dance? This can effectively enhance team cohesion!”
Su Yu frowned. “The negative price of every Mind Corridor-level Awakened is relatively serious. If we forcefully gather them together, not only might they not be able to become friends, but it’s also easy to become enemies.”
Shang Jianyao nodded and laughed. “I thought of another reason. If we allow Mind Corridor-level Awakened to know each other and succeed in forming a team, it will be difficult for the Board of Directors to manage them!”
Su Yu’s expression immediately froze.
“Watch it. You will be silenced if you tell the truth!” The honest Shang Jianyao grumbled at his rash peer.
Su Yu undoubtedly heard this.
He rubbed his cheeks and smiled. “That’s about it for today. I might request you to go through two to three physical examinations in the future.”
“No problem!” Shang Jianyao replied firmly.
After he walked out of Room 506, Su Yu leaned back and placed his left hand on the armchair’s armrest. He looked at the air ahead and fell into deep thought.
At this moment, the door opened again with a clang.
As Shang Jianyao resisted the guards’ interception, he jumped up and shouted, “Director Su, I have another question! Can I have lunch in the canteen on this floor?”
Su Yu rubbed his temples and forced a smile. “Sure.”
Finally, Shang Jianyao quietly left.
Su Yu took nearly a minute to regain his composure. He gently patted the sofa’s armrest, looked at the air in front of him, and muttered to himself thoughtfully, 102…

Chapter 754: Happy
Translator: CKtalon
On the 647th floor, Room 14.
After Jiang Baimian finished writing up the contributions that she needed to submit today, she stood up, rubbed her shoulders, and said to Long Yuehong and Bai Chen, “Since we have nothing to do, let’s go to the training room for some exercise.”
“Alright!” The person who replied wasn’t Long Yuehong or Bai Chen but Shang Jianyao, who had suddenly appeared at the door.
Jiang Baimian glanced at him and scoffed. “Didn’t you say that you wanted to experience the board’s exclusive canteen? Why are you back so early? It’s not even noon!”
As far as she knew, there was no so-called Board of Directors exclusive canteen at all. There was only the management’s exclusive canteen. Of course, the directors had special treatment when they went to any exclusive canteen for management. It was equivalent to having a private room with special dishes served.
Shang Jianyao sighed in disappointment. “It’s because I’m too early that I could only wait in the corridor on the fifth floor. The guards found me unsightly and that I was a stain on the environment, so they kept urging me to leave.”
The fifth floor of Pangu Biology’s underground building was the Management Zone.
If you weren’t an Awakened in the Mind Corridor and had a high status, those guards definitely wouldn’t just be persuading you… Jiang Baimian smiled and said, “And you came back just like that?”
“Otherwise? I’ve always been law-abiding and a model employee.” This was indeed how Shang Jianyao thought of himself.
Jiang Baimian laughed. “It will be difficult for you to go to the fifth floor again. Without the higher-ups there inviting you and obtaining permission in advance, you won’t be able to enter.”
This was still a relatively relaxed situation. If anything happened, the alert level would rise. Employees who didn’t obtain permission couldn’t even press the corresponding elevator button if they wanted to go to the fifth floor or lower.
As for the fire escape routes, they would definitely be sealed. Furthermore, there were many of them. The ordinary employees and management used different stairs.
“It’s fine. I’ve already spoken to them; they will open the door for me when the time comes.” Shang Jianyao smiled smugly.
“Spoken to them?” Long Yuehong asked in confusion.
Shang Jianyao nodded in all seriousness. “That’s right. I made many friends there.”
Made friends… The corners of Long Yuehong’s mouth twitched in response.
Jiang Baimian asked in exasperation and amusement, “Since you’ve already made friends, why did you return? Can’t you just stay on the fifth floor?”
Shang Jianyao frankly replied, “What they said does make sense. I agree that me squatting there waiting is quite unsightly.”
Did you make friends with them to be convinced by them? Jiang Baimian rolled her eyes and gave up on following Shang Jianyao’s train of thought.
She pointed in the direction of the changing room. “Let’s go to the training room.”
“The spot you’re pointing in doesn’t seem right,” the honest Shang Jianyao pointed out.
Jiang Baimian flew into a rage out of humiliation. “So you don’t change before training?”
“Oh!” Shang Jianyao clapped, making Jiang Baimian feel like killing him.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen didn’t dare to interject or speak.
After the team members changed and entered the training room, Jiang Baimian was in no rush to find someone to spar with. Instead, she did some aerobics to warm up her muscles bit by bit.
As she practiced, she glanced not far away and teased, “Why are the two of you so affectionate when you’re stretching each other? Give me back my eyes!”
Long Yuehong immediately felt embarrassed, while Bai Chen was completely unaffected and replied, “You can also find someone to help you stretch.”
Jiang Baimian opened her mouth and was speechless.
Rage rose in her that she had no qualms about doing anything. She turned her head to Shang Jianyao and said, “Come, let’s have a fight first!”
Shang Jianyao gasped exaggeratedly. “Don’t hit the face!”
The two of them put on their armor and boxing gloves, walked to the middle of the training room, and began sparring.
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bang! Bang!
Jiang Baimian attacked like a raging fire. Her fists were like dragons, beating Shang Jianyao as he ran around cowering.
“Why did you use all your strength today?” Shang Jianyao asked in confusion as he ran and blocked.
Jiang Baimian smiled brightly. “I’m happy today!”
To be honest, she was indeed in a good mood. As she had successfully returned home last night, she took the initiative to mention that only the Eighth Research Institute remained to be found for the subsequent missions when faced with Madam Xue’s complaints of ‘not knowing when she will be out on another mission’ and ‘don’t make us parents die after our child.’ She then said that the subsequent missions would be left to the company. They only needed to do some of the things assigned to them and didn’t have to go out all the time.
This made her parents very happy.
Jiang Baimian’s mood improved when she saw that they were happy. Therefore, she made Shang Jianyao experience her happiness.
…
495th floor, Zone C, Room 11.
After dinner, Long Yuehong—who hadn’t gone home to sleep yesterday—nervously opened his door.
Long Dayong, Gu Hong, and Long Aihong sat in their respective seats as they watched the LCD screen on the television cabinet by the wall.
Long Yuehong had used contribution points to exchange for this before his last mission.
It was said that a company had moved it out of Swamp Ruin 1, and the company had returned several screens to them.
This thing was actually useless in Pangu Biology. After all, the Entertainment Department had only recently considered the possibility of forming a television station. The LCD screens in the company’s Rec Center were really just used to show some information or to give people who liked to sing during weekends a background when there were the corresponding activities.
In very few cases, the Entertainment Department would send specialized personnel to play Old World films to enrich the employees’ leisure lives.
However, the Long family had a laptop that Long Yuehong had brought back with him; it contained a large amount of Old World entertainment. Compared to the small laptop screen, it was clearly better to play the content on a larger LCD screen.
“I’m back.” Long Yuehong glanced at the flickering scene on the LCD screen and recognized that it was a drama serial that he found garrulous.
“Okay.” Gu Hong nodded.
Long Dayong turned his head to look at the door and casually said, “Ah, you’re back.”
With that said, he cast his gaze back at the LCD screen.
Long Aihong didn’t even raise her eyelids. She didn’t say a word and was abnormally focused.
Although he didn’t receive the attention he deserved, Long Yuehong heaved a sigh of relief. He then casually found a seat in the living room and sat down to watch the television with his family.
After an episode ended, Gu Hong seemed to come to a realization and reprimanded Long Yuehong. “Why didn’t you say anything when you entered?”
Long Yuehong didn’t know how to respond. His experience was to just ignore the comment.
As expected, Gu Hong’s focus quickly shifted. She smiled and took out an irregular cube made of light-yellow paper from her pocket.
Gu Hong then looked at the window and suppressed her voice. “Here, a Babymaker talisman!”
“What talisman?” Long Yuehong reached out to take it with a confused expression.
Gu Hong smiled. “The Babymaker talisman! It can bless your wife with a child soon.”
Long Yuehong glanced at his mother suspiciously. “Where did you get it?”
He remembered that only the older generation had such a culture of using Babymaker talismans. At his parents’ generation, genetic enhancement technology had already matured. Many problems of infertility had never been inherited, so there was no need to pray for additional blessings.
However, nothing was absolute. Genetic enhancement could only be said to have eliminated some problems in advance, but the effects of everyone’s enhancements were different. Some were good, and some were bad. For example, Long Yuehong himself was only 1.75 meters tall after genetic enhancement.
Gu Hong replied righteously, “From your grandmother!”
“Alright.” Long Yuehong casually accepted the Babymaker talisman and stuffed it into his pocket.
As Bai Chen had asked him to stay at home today, he had nothing to do and decided to visit the Rec Center to have a chat with his old classmates and friends he hadn’t seen in months.
After entering the Rec Center, Long Yuehong casually swept his gaze around and suddenly felt a little down. He saw the newly transferred Rec Center’s PIC.
This lady didn’t live on the 495th floor; she only came here to work every day.
Sigh, why would a nice person like Grandpa Chen be infected with the Heartless disease… What a sudden disaster… Long Yuehong sighed inwardly and walked to a corner of the Rec Center.
The Old Task Force had now preliminarily confirmed that the reason Chen Xianyu—the former PIC of the 495th floor’s Rec Center—was infected with the Heartless disease was that a few New World powerhouses from the company had temporarily returned during First City’s uprising to guard against any accidents. This inevitably resulted in a portion of the Heartless virus leaking from the New World into Pangu Biology.
Long Yuehong had just sat down, and before he could adjust his mindset and search for an acquaintance, he heard Shang Jianyao’s voice.
“Everyone, everyone, what song do you want to hear? The Spring Welcoming Singing Competition is about to begin. I need more practice.”
Long Yuehong looked over with a blank expression and saw Shang Jianyao wearing a dark-blue coat and holding a microphone as he stood in front of the Rec Center’s LCD screen to seek everyone’s opinion.
Beside his feet, the small black speaker with a blue bottom was prepared to fire at any moment.
The people playing cards, playing chess, and chatting in the Rec Center replied, “It has to be more festive!”
“It has to make people happy listening to it!”
…
Shang Jianyao listened seriously and waved his hand. “Give me a minute.”
He squatted down and adjusted the small speaker’s playlist.
Before long, he stood up, and music sounded.
Shang Jianyao’s body began to sway with the rhythm, and his voice sounded through the microphone. “Congratulations on becoming rich.
“Congratulations on being wonderful.
“The best ones, please come over.
“The bad, please leave1…”

Chapter 755: Confronting ‘Danger’
Translator: CKtalon
The catchy festive song livened up the Rec Center. The employees present chatted and laughed, and they would hum from time to time. It made Long Yuehong feel like he was celebrating the new year.
For almost all Pangu Biology employees, the Lunar New Year was definitely the best and most relaxing period. They would choose to throw problems to the back of their minds as long as it wasn’t life-threatening or urgent. They would first celebrate the Lunar New Year before anything else.
At the end and beginning of the year, every family would’ve saved up for a year and were willing to use a portion of their saved contribution points to reward themselves and their family. When the time came, Pangu Biology would definitely increase the supply of meat, vegetables, sweets, soda, and snacks. It would also produce rare items that employees usually didn’t see.
Long Yuehong connected the Lunar New Year to tables filled with good dishes, sweet beverages, and delicious sweets, new clothes, as well as kids enjoying all kinds of fun games.
Before joining the Old Task Force, he had looked forward to the Lunar New Year the most in the year. Although he could often eat good food now, he still missed the atmosphere.
The Lunar New Year is at the end of January; there are about four months left… Long Yuehong looked forward to it.
The bustle at the Rec Center on the 495th floor lasted until it was almost lights out. There was a pause in the middle because Shang Jianyao insisted on listening to the radio.
In a happy mood, Shang Jianyao washed up before the lights went out and went to the bathroom.
After lying down, he massaged his temples and closed his eyes.
…
Mind Corridor, Room 506.
Shang Jianyao smiled as he turned the brass handle and pushed open the door.
As expected, he entered a place that was suspected to be a laboratory. The silver-white metal walls partitioned many small rooms, and inside were different complicated instruments.
Shang Jianyao looked around and focused on the people coming and going. They were all wearing light-blue masks and white coats, and they were in a rush or unsmiling.
Shang Jianyao stopped a person in a white coat as if he were familiar with him. “What is this place?”
The man in the white coat turned his head to glance at him, and his gaze instantly turned sharp. “Who are you? How did you sneak in? Who instructed you?”
Without waiting for Shang Jianyao to come up with an answer, he pulled back and shouted, “Guards! Guards! The experimental subject has escaped!”
Thud! Thud! Thud!
Black-clothed guards ran over from all directions holding submachine guns. Several of them were even wearing military exoskeletons.
“How terrifying!” The expression on Shang Jianyao’s face didn’t match his words. He began to mutter to himself, “Face the danger directly with courage… Face the danger directly with courage… So I have to force my way out?”
In the blink of an eye, Shang Jianyao stomped his feet and jumped toward the door that seemed to lead to the corridor.
He didn’t rashly use his abilities. This wasn’t because he had experienced the cruise ship trauma and had learned his lesson. He was afraid that an Awakened’s abilities would bring about unnecessary changes and cause him to encounter an irresistible influence. After all, the strategy guide had clearly written that abilities could be used for any psychological trauma related to Room 506.
The only reason he didn’t do so was: this made things more interesting!
Using abilities directly would make the problem much simpler. The danger level would be reduced by at least one-third!
As he ran, Shang Jianyao suddenly ‘fell’ and slid forward for a distance. This wasn’t because he had been affected by an Awakened ability but an action of his free will.
Badump!
One of the guards was caught off-guard and couldn’t stop in time before he was knocked over.
Shang Jianyao pounced on him and picked up a black object. He then did a pulling action and threw the black object at the nearest guard wearing a military exoskeleton.
With the comprehensive warning system’s help, the guard preliminarily determined that it was a grenade because everyone carried one.
He quickly ducked to the side and hid behind a machine. The nearby guards did the same.
The military exoskeleton wasn’t kinetic armor; it didn’t completely cover the body. It couldn’t prevent the wearer from suffering damage when it encountered an explosion or shrapnel.
Pa!
The black object landed to the side without exploding.
“Haha.” Shang Jianyao laughed. “Sorry, I threw the wrong item.”
He slung a submachine gun over himself and held a black grenade in his left hand. He threw and caught it repeatedly.
The black object from before was quietly lying on the ground—it was a black leather shoe.
Upon hearing his words and sensing that there was no explosion, the guards ran over.
Shang Jianyao shook his left arm and threw the real grenade upon seeing this. At the same time, he rolled to the corridor.
Ta! Ta! Ta!
Rows of bullet holes appeared randomly from where he had previously been standing.
Boom!
Just as the black grenade flew out, it was hit by a guard wearing a military exoskeleton and detonated in advance.
The blast and shrapnel effectively stopped the other guards from rushing into the corridor.
Shang Jianyao jumped up and laughed boisterously again. “Thanks!”
He then muttered to himself, “Face the danger directly with courage… Face the danger directly with courage…”
He ran to the end of the corridor, where there were still a few guards.
Shang Jianyao raised the submachine gun he had snatched and fired in a sweeping motion.
Amidst the sparks, some of the guards fell to the ground, and some hurriedly searched for cover. They were momentarily unable to stop Shang Jianyao’s approach.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao suddenly felt a sense of numbness in his body.
Bang!
He fell to the ground and muttered excitedly, “Awakened…”
His voice suddenly rose. “There’s no grudge between us, so why are you intercepting me? How much did they pay you? I’ll pay double!”
His half-body paralysis quickly subsided.
He implanted the Awakened with the idea that everyone should peacefully coexist and walk their own paths.
Upon seeing that his abilities had taken effect, Shang Jianyao propped himself up with one hand and jumped to his feet.
His target was the end of the corridor.
Behind him, the guards rushed out one after another. In front of him, the enemies—who had been in a rush to hide—reorganized their defense line.
Shang Jianyao opened his mouth again, attempting to shout.
At this moment, the Shang Jianyao that sought novelty hissed in his mind. “That’s not right. This isn’t called facing danger directly.
“This isn’t considered dangerous at all. The room owner’s greatest fear that she finds most dangerous is to be captured! I have to face this danger!”
With a swoosh, he stopped and raised his hands. He then slowly squatted down and placed his palms on the back of his head.
Black figures flew over as guards pinned him down.
Before long, Shang Jianyao was tied up and gagged.
He widened his eyes, curious about what would happen next.
He was soon fixed to a metal bed. A few humans in light-blue masks and white coats walked over.
“What do you plan on doing to me?” Shang Jianyao asked in fear.
The white coat leader blurted out in surprise, “Aren’t you gagged?”
After asking, he realized that a new mouth had grown out of Shang Jianyao’s forehead. This belonged to the one who sought novelty and was filled with the desire to act.
“That’s right!” The mouth opened and closed in frustration. “I forgot!”
He then said, “Begin. Do whatever experiment you want. I won’t say a word and will only watch!”
The next second, the mouth disappeared.
However, pairs of eyes appeared on Shang Jianyao’s cheeks, chin, chest, abdomen, and the back of his hand one after another without blinking.
The eyes of the people in white coats became extremely terrified.
Someone shouted, “Men! Men, inject him with anesthetic—using the standards of an adult elephant!”
Shang Jianyao’s ten pairs of eyes witnessed a syringe—which was as thick as his forearm—inject the liquid into his body.
He muttered to himself, “Face the danger directly with courage… Face the danger directly with courage…”
Just like that, he fainted and had a good sleep.
When he woke up, the laboratory was empty.
“What kind of change is this?” Shang Jianyao sat up cross-legged and stroked his chin. “The room owner was indeed captured back then and was also injected with anesthetic. What he saw when he woke up was this scene? His psychological trauma is this place, not this matter. Therefore, it’s considered a success no matter how I escape?”
The ‘strategy guide’ provided by Pangu Biology was to escape the place and advance bravely.
This also counted as clearing this psychological trauma; nobody had tried to be captured previously.
…
495th floor, Zone C, Room 11.
Long Yuehong was lighting a lamp and packing up his clothes.
After finishing this matter, he sat down and planned on resting before washing up. Since he had nothing to do, he took out the Babymaker talisman his mother—Gu Hong—had given him.
As his finger stroked the yellowish talisman’s surface, Long Yuehong suddenly felt that something was amiss.
This piece of paper was relatively new and didn’t look like it had been passed down from his grandmother’s generation.

As a Security Department employee who had been on the surface for extended periods, Long Yuehong realized that the Babymaker talisman’s paper was relatively new. It didn’t look like it had been passed down from the previous generation.
He instinctively straightened his back and raised his guard. He then looked around and listened for a few seconds.
After confirming that there was nothing abnormal, he tried to unfold the irregular, square paper talisman.
As the light-yellow paper unfolded, a pattern outlined in vermilion handwriting entered Long Yuehong’s eyes. This looked like a warped human silhouette, but it also looked like a few strange words stacked together.
Long Yuehong studied it for a while but didn’t find the corresponding item in his memories, nor did he find it vile.
The talismans left behind by the Old World did resemble this. As for whether it was useful, that was another matter.
Long Yuehong felt more comforted.
There’s no problem… I’ll consult Team Leader tomorrow. She knows the Old World’s folklore very well… Long Yuehong heaved a sigh of relief and prepared to return the talisman to its original state.
He failed shamefully.
He failed despite following the folding lines. He only barely managed to fold it into an irregular square, one that was completely different from the original.
At this moment, a scene suddenly surfaced in his mind: Shang Jianyao standing behind him, leaning toward his ear, and saying gloomily, “Oh no, you can’t restore this talisman. Something terrifying will happen…”
Long Yuehong quickly shook his head and threw this horror story-like connection to the side.
He planned on getting Little White to help restore it tomorrow. He felt that Bai Chen was much better than him in this regard.
After putting away the Babymaker talisman, Long Yuehong stood up and went to the cramped bathroom at home.
…
Mind Corridor, Room 506.
Shang Jianyao sat on the metal bed and looked around, realizing that he and the instruments were the only ones left in the hall. It was empty as if it had been abandoned for a long time.
He stood up with his feet on the ground and scoffed. “What unprofessional villains! Why didn’t they destroy the equipment when they gave up on this experiment base?”
A head burrowed out of Shang Jianyao’s left shoulder and retorted his peer. “Maybe they encountered an accident and had to evacuate in a rush?”
The rash Shang Jianyao chuckled. “Why don’t you say that all the humans here had evaporated into thin air?”
“It’s not impossible,” the honest Shang Jianyao argued.
As they spoke, they jointly controlled their body and made it walk to different instruments so that they could confirm their uses and search for the corresponding experimental records.
The honest Shang Jianyao gave his evaluation first. “This instrument is very strange. It seems to be a product of crossbreeding between an MRI machine and an electrocardiograph…”
The rash Shang Jianyao immediately suggested, “Why don’t we switch it on and give it a try?”
“How? Who will do the honors?” Zen Master Redemption stuck his head out from the chest.
This was a literal depiction of a Buddhist phrase: ‘one could drink alcohol and eat meat as long as Buddha was in the heart.’
The rash Shang Jianyao replied without hesitation, “Me!”
The head that originally belonged to the honest Shang Jianyao directed the right hand to stroke his chin and smile. “Is there such a possibility? The room owner doesn’t have sufficient scientific literacy. Back then, he was too flustered, nervous, and in a rush. He only wanted to escape and didn’t make any observations. Therefore, the instruments in his psychological trauma are products of overlapping impressions. They don’t correspond to the actual effects, so it’s impossible to test their true effects.”
The honest Shang Jianyao drilled out from the other shoulder. “Big White said: Make bold assumptions and carefully verify them. This is only an assumption. There has to be a subsequent verification process!”
“Let me do it!” The rash Shang Jianyao boldly walked toward the instrument.
After some work, he felt that he might’ve only done an electrocardiogram.
After testing the instruments and flipping through the drawers, the Shang Jianyaos entered the corridor in disappointment and searched for other rooms.
He pushed open the door next door, and his gaze suddenly froze.
In different parts of the room bathed in pure white light were transparent glass columns. The columns were filled with a light-yellow liquid, and naked humans were soaked in them.
This was somewhat similar to a scene they had seen in Wasteland Ruin 13’s secret laboratory. However, the human bodies soaked here meant that something was clearly amiss.
Some of them had two heads; others had a vertical eye cracking out of their foreheads. Some had soft skulls, and their faces were half-deformed. Some were covered in black scales, some seemed to have lost their skin, and some had flesh sprouts growing out of their faces. Some had five hands and seven legs…
Shang Jianyao sometimes gritted his teeth, and sometimes his eyes lit up. He walked into the room and ventured deeper.
The deeper he went, the more abnormal the humans soaked in the glass columns became. Shang Jianyao gradually discovered a few corpses that could give people nightmares late at night.
One of the heads was sliced open from the middle, and pale flesh connected the left and right parts.
Another specific surface was covered in black and hairy spots.
The most memorable body had its limbs and body extremely atrophied. Its head was twice the size of a normal person’s, and it floated in the liquid like a jellyfish.
“They also do genetic mutation induction?” Shang Jianyao’s expression gradually turned cold. “They are in the same field as the company and the White Knights? Or are they some research institute that was the company or the White Knights’ former incarnation?”
He looked around as he walked. He didn’t encounter any more danger, but he didn’t discover anything valuable.
Just like that, he entered one room after another before walking out in disappointment.
When he felt a little exhausted, the metal door to the experimental base appeared in front of him.
“It’s almost over? Is walking out considered clearing this psychological trauma?” The calm and rational Shang Jianyao stroked his chin.
The rash him smiled smugly. “This is because I have the courage to face danger. If it were anyone else, they most likely wouldn’t wake up after being injected with such a large dose of anesthetic. They would also become a vegetable in reality.”
“From the strategy guide’s point of view, this room is indeed quite simple.” The Shang Jianyao that sought novelty had a look of regret and disappointment.
“Shall we leave?” Zen Master Redemption Shang Jianyao asked.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go out. It seems like the room owner didn’t notice many valuable clues back then.”
The Shang Jianyao that abhorred evil said, “Before leaving, I want to blow up the room with soaked corpses.”
“This is only another person’s psychological trauma. There’s no point in blowing it up. Are you that serious when you play games?” The ruthless Shang Jianyao was peeved and amused.
“Yes!” Shang Jianyao—who abhorred evil—nodded.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao laughed. “Then, blow it up.”
Boom!
As a gigantic fireball appeared in the corresponding room, Shang Jianyao pushed open the metal door and walked out.
Sunlight shone into his eyes, and the entire world instantly turned illusory.
In the blink of an eye, buildings appeared in front of him—buildings that were part of the same complex.
Shang Jianyao rubbed his temples and chose to leave.
495th floor, Zone B, Room 196.
He opened his eyes and examined himself. “I’m still unable to separate my powers to fuse it into an item in reality… Just a little short… It should be enough after clearing another psychological trauma.”
Shang Jianyao laughed. “We can still explore Room 506 and try the second psychological trauma.”
He didn’t plan on trying the third spot because it was clearly written in the strategy guide: “After grasping the key points, this room is relatively safe. It can be used as a ‘base’ for rookies to temper their minds. Therefore, it’s not recommended to explore to a relatively deep extent to prevent affecting the room owner. If you happen to encounter a fluctuation in his mind, it’s best to provide him with a certain level of help. Don’t kill the golden goose…”
As a group of polite people, the Shang Jianyaos naturally didn’t want to disturb the room owner.
…
The next morning, Room 14 on the 647th floor.
Long Yuehong stood up, walked to Jiang Baimian’s desk, and took out the Babymaker talisman. “Team Leader, can you help me see if the symbols on this talisman are normal?”
“Talisman?” Jiang Baimian curiously took the talisman.
Shang Jianyao came over, and Bai Chen walked over.
Jiang Baimian unfolded the talisman and said as she read, “I don’t recognize this symbol. I can only say that it’s indeed similar to the ones in the Old World’s talismans. What talisman is this?”
Long Yuehong hesitated for a moment before answering, “Babymaker talisman. My mother got it from my grandmother.”
“Oh.” Jiang Baimian resisted the urge to tease him.
Bai Chen fell silent.
Shang Jianyao slapped the table and pounded the bench while laughing. “If this is useful, won’t this action be more effective?”
He seriously assumed a rocking posture while cradling a baby—this was the Life Ritual Church’s salutation.
Jiang Baimian coughed and looked at Long Yuehong in an attempt to soothe over the atmosphere. “Do you think there’s a problem?”
“I think this piece of paper is a little new. It doesn’t seem like it was passed down from my grandmother’s generation,” Long Yuehong said truthfully.
Bai Chen was immediately a little concerned and cast her gaze at the Babymaker talisman again.
Jiang Baimian nodded slightly and said, “I’ll go back tonight and help you search up this symbol. Most of my information is on the computer at home. You can also ask your mother and grandmother. What if they just replicated the original one because it was too old and tattered?”
As she spoke, she tore off a piece of paper and drew the pattern on the Babymaker talisman.
Long Yuehong tersely acknowledged it. “Alright.”
He paused and voiced his worry. “I’m just afraid that they are believers of a Kalendaria and joined some strange Church.”
If that happened, the problem would be very, very troublesome.
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped for Long Yuehong.
Jiang Baimian also praised, “Not bad. You are sufficiently vigilant.”
Shang Jianyao immediately crossed his arms and placed them in front of his chest.. He then took a step back and suppressed his voice. “Always be vigilant!”

Jiang Baimian glanced at Shang Jianyao and reminded Long Yuehong, “Since you have the corresponding worries, you need to carry out your questioning with technique. Don’t let anyone suspect anything.”
“Got it.” Long Yuehong nodded heavily.
Shang Jianyao had a look of ‘worry.’ “I’m not too confident in your oratory skills. Will you really be fine dealing with such matters?”
Long Yuehong immediately hesitated and didn’t dare to guarantee anything. After all, he wasn’t in charge of negotiations most of the time while out on the Ashlands. To put it more tactfully, he was ranked fifth in negotiations with external parties among the Old Task Force members.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “I have two solutions to ensure that nothing goes wrong.”
Although Long Yuehong didn’t trust this fellow’s solution, he still felt there was no harm in asking. He took the initiative to ask, “What’s the solution?”
Shang Jianyao looked at Bai Chen. “First, bring Little White with you and get her to be your second brain to help you negotiate.”
Jiang Baimian—who was drinking water—almost choked.
Long Yuehong seriously considered the feasibility of this method and slowly shook his head. “It won’t work. It’s not good to bring Little White to my house in a rush without informing them in advance. After all, we have already decided on the weekend. We’ll talk about it when the time comes.”
He felt that Bai Chen’s first meeting with his parents had to be sufficiently formal and that he couldn’t rashly change plans. This would affect Bai Chen’s image in his parents’ hearts.
“Then, you can wait until the weekend to ask.” Bai Chen gave her suggestion.
Long Yuehong fell silent for a few seconds before saying, “If there’s really a problem with this matter, it will only worsen the trouble if it drags on.”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped. “Not bad; you have your own ideas!”
You sound like you’re trying to sow discord… Jiang Baimian muttered, planning to hold Shang Jianyao back if he continued.
Long Yuehong was just about to explain when Shang Jianyao changed the topic. “The second solution is for me to implant a set of thoughts on how to negotiate with foreign parties in you. The reference target is…”
He paused and said, “Drum roll~ Me!”
“Forget it then,” Long Yuehong replied without hesitation. “Even if you implant a corresponding thought into me, I can’t use Inference Clowning.”
“Then, Big White’s?” Shang Jianyao enthusiastically did a sales pitch.
Long Yuehong was tempted, and Bai Chen nodded slightly.
Jiang Baimian chuckled. “Can you weave the complete set of thoughts I have when I communicate with outsiders?”
Even I can’t do it myself!
“No.” Shang Jianyao shook his head frankly. He then sighed. “It would be good if Old Ge is here. He has established the corresponding models and database.”
Long Yuehong took an inconspicuous deep breath. “It’s better if I do it myself. I’ll be careful and pay attention to the environment and reactions. If the scene really isn’t suitable, I’ll leave it for the weekend.”
Jiang Baimian and Bai Chen were just about to nod when Shang Jianyao’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Why don’t we change our train of thought?”
“Change our train of thought?” Long Yuehong had always known that Shang Jianyao’s train of thought was unconstrained and impossible to guess.
Shang Jianyao’s smile lit up. “I’ll ask on your behalf.”
“Don’t joke around.” Long Yuehong instinctively reacted.
Shang Jianyao added, “I’ll use Thought Guidance to make your grandparents, parents, siblings, and other relatives think that I’m you. Isn’t this equivalent to you asking?”
He spread his palms with a ‘trust me’ expression.
Long Yuehong subconsciously analyzed the situation and realized that it was actually feasible. However, he felt abnormally terrified when he imagined how his family, relatives, and friends would treat Shang Jianyao as him and chat happily with him.
He quickly shook his head. “No, it’s fine.”
Shang Jianyao tried to persuade him. “Life is short, so why not give it a try?”
Smack!
Jiang Baimian slapped his arm with her right hand. “Stop bullying Little Red. Go busy yourself.”
Upon seeing her stand up, Shang Jianyao diverted his attention. “Where are you going?”
Jiang Baimian casually replied, “Minister Xenny asked me to go over for a report. She wanted to talk about the details that weren’t written in the report.”
According to the procedure, this was the second last segment. After that, it was time to calculate their contribution and distribute the rewards.
“Oh, oh.” Shang Jianyao asked, “Do you want me to lead the way?”
Jiang Baimian fumed at being hit in a sore spot. “Isn’t it just the deputy minister’s office on the 646th floor? I can find it!”
It wouldn’t be a problem to walk slower and think more!
As she spoke, she passed through the office and walked out of the room.
After walking for dozens of meters, she encountered a former comrade and chatted with him. After chatting, she accidentally got lost.
Looking at the familiar rooms around her, Jiang Baimian calculated and observed the door numbers.
She was still relatively good at remembering numbers.
After walking back to the spot she had previously lost herself by following the door number, Jiang Baimian saw Shang Jianyao standing there with his hands in his pockets.
“What are you doing here?” Jiang Baimian asked first.
Shang Jianyao had an innocent expression. “I came out to use the bathroom.”
He casually pointed in the direction he had come from.
Jiang Baimian received the ‘hint’ and identified the correct path. She then waved her hand and said, “Go.”
She turned around and walked to the right stairwell.
As she waited for the elevator, she ran through the layout of the 647th floor in her mind.
The bathroom closest to us doesn’t seem to be at that intersection… Jiang Baimian suddenly exclaimed.
At this moment, at Room 14’s door, Long Yuehong looked at Shang Jianyao—who had walked back—and asked in confusion, “Why are you going there?”
“I got lost.” Shang Jianyao smiled with a look that warranted a beating.
Long Yuehong could only say, “Fortunately, Team Leader isn’t around.”
…
On the 646th floor, in Xenny’s deputy minister’s office.
After knocking on the wrong door, Jiang Baimian finally found the right place.
Xenny—who had long chestnut hair and looked to be in her thirties—didn’t warmly invite Jiang Baimian to sit on the sofa. Instead, she pointed at the chair opposite her desk and said, “Have a seat.”
“Minister, what else would you like to ask? The report is very detailed.” Jiang Baimian took the initiative.
Xenny picked up the sky-blue porcelain teacup and took a sip. “I’m mainly concerned about your health. How many islands have you cleared in the Sea of Origins?”
“Three.” Jiang Baimian didn’t hide anything. “I’m in the midst of searching for the fourth one.”
Xenny revealed an approving expression. “Your mental fortitude has always been good. It’s reasonable for you to progress so quickly. Yes, there’s no rush. As the number of islands you clear increases, the negative price you pay will worsen. Take more time to get used to it. It will be more conducive for your daily life.”
“I understand.” Jiang Baimian the order of priority.
Xenny then asked, “What’s your next plan?”
Jiang Baimian said seriously, “The first is to find the last of the Five Great Holy Lands—Dajiang City’s Linhe Village. The second is to make a trip to Icefield and strive to lock onto the Eighth Research Institute’s exact location. On the way, we will also go to the city that Shang Jianyao’s father last appeared in to search for clues regarding the Heartless disease.”
Xenny fell silent for a few seconds before saying, “It’s not like you can find where the Eighth Research Institute is hiding after going to Icefield once or twice. The gathering and extraction of information and clues in advance is a relatively important segment. Also, Icefield isn’t suitable for human survival in this season. It’s best if you wait until spring before setting off.”
“We won’t go even if you want us to,” Jiang Baimian replied with a smile.
She had no objections to staying in the company for a few months. Ever since she revealed that she didn’t have to go out often after the next mission ended, her parents had been very happy. They had even skipped the usual blind dates they scheduled for her.
Xenny asked about the four Great Holy Lands again and focused on some details. For example, if there were any traces of humans entering and leaving the cryochamber at the Holm Fertility Center in the past few years.
At the end of the conversation, Jiang Baimian took the initiative to say, “Minister, our team’s Long Yuehong and Bai Chen are a couple. They are planning on registering their marriage soon. Can they be transferred elsewhere internally?”
Xenny smiled. “With your contributions, it definitely won’t be a problem. Besides, newlyweds aren’t suitable for fieldwork.”
“I’m relieved.” Jiang Baimian smiled.
This was the promise she wanted.
…
495th floor, Zone C, Room 11.
Long Yuehong chatted with his parents and sister as they ate dinner. He casually mentioned, “Mom, the Babymaker talisman you gave me doesn’t look old.”
“What do you mean old?” Gu Hong didn’t understand.
Long Yuehong simply explained, “I thought it was a Babymaker talisman used by Grandpa and Grandma, but I realized that it’s quite new.”
Gu Hong thought for a moment. “I didn’t notice. Ask your grandmother later.”
“Maybe she got someone to draw it again,” guessed Long Dayong.
“Who?” Long Yuehong tried his best to make it seem like he was casually chatting.
Long Dayong casually replied, “Some of our ancestors draw such things and have passed down their skills. Many people pray for auspiciousness during festive seasons.”
“Is that so…” Although Long Yuehong didn’t think there was anything wrong, he felt that the answer was too simple.
After dinner, he carried a bag of fruits he had exchanged using his contribution points and headed to the 417th floor where his grandparents lived.

Underground building, 417th floor.
Long Yuehong looked at his watch and confirmed the time. He didn’t go to his grandparents’ house but went straight to the Rec Center.
As expected, he immediately saw his grandfather—Long Yixuan—holding a thermos and chatting with a group of middle-aged and elderly employees. His grandmother, Zhong Zining, was further inside, playing cards with her neighbors.
Back when he was in university, Long Yuehong was especially envious of his grandfather and grandmother’s lives.
Their grandchildren were mostly grown up, and they were almost retirement age. They were still in relatively good physical condition, so apart from not being able to go to the surface, they could live their daily lives rather freely.
Furthermore, after working so hard for so many years, they each had a certain rank of employment. Although they weren’t considered high, they had the advantage of not needing to help their children. They were completely self-sufficient for their daily necessities, and they could also have a feast from time to time.
Long Yuehong carried the bag of fruits and sat beside his grandmother, Zhong Zining. He smiled and asked, “Did you win?”
These retired and semi-retired old employees betted small and mainly played for entertainment. They would even split one contribution point into ten portions and leave it on a tab before settling the accounts.
Zhong Zining grumbled, “I didn’t win a few rounds.”
Although she was grumbling, the old lady with much white hair still smiled and muttered, “Why are you bringing up fruits again? You’re about to get married and are about to have children. You have to save up, understand?”
As the saying goes, the youngest son and eldest grandson were most cherished by an old lady. As the firstborn of the Long family’s third generation, Long Yuehong had always been doted on by his grandparents and had a good relationship with them.
Long Yuehong smiled and explained, “Little White told me to bring these to you guys as a form of respect.”
He had already told his grandparents that his fiancee’s name was Bai Chen.
Of course, Bai Chen—whose parents had passed away relatively early—was a wilderness nomad to her bones; she actually didn’t have such self-awareness. Long Yuehong had always freeloaded from his grandparents’ house for food and drink, and he also didn’t have the habit of bringing gifts. Fortunately, the Old Task Force had an Old World folklore researcher and Pangu Biology’s model child, Jiang Baimian. From time to time, she would give the young couple some advice.
Long Yuehong was deeply inspired and connected this to a sentence in the song Shang Jianyao sang: Nobody would blame you for being polite!
Zhong Zining exclaimed, “Little White is too polite.”
Although she said that, the smile on her face became brighter. At the same time, she took out a few fruits and distributed them to her mahjong friends. “Try it. Try it. A gift from my granddaughter-in-law.”
She couldn’t hide the smugness in her tone.
So what if your grandchildren were assigned a partner as soon as they became of age? My eldest grandson’s wife has a high rank, has many contribution points, and knows how to respect her elders!
Grandma is so generous today… Long Yuehong muttered inwardly.
Fruits within Pangu Biology weren’t something ordinary families could eat often. Long Yuehong remembered that his grandparents would hide them well every time they exchanged for fruits. Not to mention outsiders, even his parents rarely gave them fruit. Only people of the younger generation like him would rummage through them and say, “Hurry up and eat. It will spoil if you don’t eat it.”
Upon seeing the neighbors around the card table stop and eat the fruits, Long Yuehong casually said, “I chatted with Little White about your and Grandpa’s names before getting off work today. She felt that they are completely different from my parents, siblings, and sister.”
Zhong Zining smiled. “You have to ask your great-grandparents. They were all educated by the Old World, so they might like to come up with such names. Sigh, your great-grandfather and great-grandmother passed away before your father was born. We could only make do by coming up with one.”
Although he already knew that his great-grandparents had passed away early, Long Yuehong couldn’t help but sigh with emotion every time he heard that. Even if they moved underground, Pangu Biology didn’t have a good time in the Chaotic Era or the early years of the New Calendar.
After chatting about the names, Long Yuehong followed the strategy he had discussed with Bai Chen, Shang Jianyao, and Jiang Baimian and took the opportunity to start the topic.
He took out the Babymaker talisman in front of everyone at the card table and asked in anticipation, “Is this really useful? It looks relatively new to me, and it doesn’t look like it was obtained from your generation.”
Zhong Zining casually replied, “The one I used to wear was already tattered. I specially got someone to draw this after your father said that you were getting married. It was very effective; I wore it back then, and I had five children. None of them died early. Your mother didn’t want it, so she only had three.”
Long Yuehong immediately asked, “Who drew it?”
Upon seeing his grandmother cast a confused gaze at him, he followed the plan and smiled. “A colleague of mine said that he also wants one if it’s effective.”
Zhong Zining came to a realization and expressed her understanding. She even felt a little pleased with herself. “It’s the Mu family in Zone B. Their ancestor was some Daoist priest; he knew how to make all kinds of talismans.”
Sounds fine… Long Yuehong heaved a sigh of relief. He then recalled something: The Eternal Time Church also had Daoists!
Zhong Zining continued, “If that colleague of yours really wants one, lead him to this floor tomorrow. I’ll bring him to request one. It’s best to request for one using a relative close to you by blood.”
“Sure, sure!” Long Yuehong tried his best to remain calm.
The conversation just now was actually a routine that Jiang Baimian had personally designed. Her goal was to push Shang Jianyao out and get him to meet the person who drew the Babymaker talisman openly as Long Yuehong’s colleague and have a nice ‘communication.’
If Long Yuehong’s grandmother was really strange, and the Babymaker talisman directly originated from her… With such a foundation, Shang Jianyao could also visit the old couple without any problems and resolve the problem easily.
The greatest benefit of this solution was that Long Yuehong’s every move was sufficiently normal and that there was nothing worth suspecting. Shang Jianyao would subsequently take over and absolve him from the trouble.
…
495th floor, Zone B, Room 196.
Shang Jianyao lay on the bed, massaged his temples, and entered the Mind Corridor.
Being urged by Jiang Baimian, he planned on clearing Room 506’s second psychological trauma as soon as possible and becoming an Awakened who had explored the Mind Corridor’s depths.
Mind Corridor, Room 506.
Shang Jianyao appeared at the door of a house. He was surrounded by similar buildings that formed a sizable community.
The people coming and going wore clothes of different colors, but these were relatively old. Some even had many patches.
Unlike the white coats in the first psychological trauma, the people here would greet and chat whenever they encountered each other. They seemed to know each other, and it was similar to the situation on each floor of Pangu Biology’s underground building’s Residential Zone.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao observed for a while before walking to a middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses who passed by.
“Are you on break today?” he greeted as if they were familiar with each other.
The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment before shaking his head and smiling. “I’m just heading home for a meal. You are?”
Shang Jianyao didn’t choke at all. “I just came back from outside. The elements really took a toll on me. I no longer look the same.”
“Oh.” The man in the gold-rimmed glasses felt a sense of guilt, feeling that it was his problem not to recognize the other party.
After implanting a thought, Shang Jianyao casually chatted. “I was sent to the Third Research Institute.”
“Isn’t that far in the south?” The man in gold-rimmed glasses was abnormally stunned. He had clearly heard of the Third Research Institute.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “That’s right. It’s almost at the beach. You might not believe it, but the Third Research Institute has now changed its name to Mechanical Paradise. Most of the people I encountered are smart bots.”
“It’s normal. They study artificial intelligence there to begin with.” The man in the gold-rimmed glasses felt that there was nothing wrong.
Shang Jianyao concealed his cold eyes and curled the corners of his mouth. “I heard from their people that the higher the research institute’s serial number is, the more advanced and valuable the research project is.”
“A meaningless guess. Our research isn’t much different from what the Second Research Institute studies; the only difference is in direction. Who can tell who’s more advanced and valuable?” The middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses scoffed at this comment.
“That’s right!” Shang Jianyao replied in a tone of deep agreement.
After chatting for a while, he turned to walk to the old lady, who was taking in the cold air outside a building.
Although the old lady had a lot of white hair, she was very hale and hearty. At this moment, she was sitting on a stool under a tree, sizing up the pedestrians around her.
“You are?” The old lady noticed Shang Jianyao’s approach.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “I’m someone sent by the Third Research Institute to visit your research institute. I want to know if you guys are really the First Research Institute established by the Old World?”
The old lady examined the fellow as if she were looking at a fool. “Did you remember wrong? This is the Fourth Research Institute!”
“How is that possible? Could it be that the higher-ups gave the wrong information?” Shang Jianyao began to put on an act.
During this process, the ruthless him laughed inwardly. So it’s the Fourth Research Institute.
He then frowned. What’s the danger here? This doesn’t seem like the second psychological trauma described in the strategy guide… Could it be that I used an unconventional method in the first psychological trauma and took the initiative to receive the anesthetic injection, so I directly jumped to the third psychological trauma?
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao looked around solemnly, searching for a place that might be dangerous.

“Granny, thank you.” Shang Jianyao waved his hand and bade the old lady under the tree farewell.
He skillfully switched identities, greeted people of different ages and conditions, and chatted about all kinds of things to figure out what this place was.
He continued chatting until his mouth was dry and he was mentally exhausted. He roughly confirmed that he was in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area.
This research institute was located deep in the uninhabited wastelands. Its main building was underground, similar to Pangu Biology.
After the Old World was destroyed, the few farms and ranches under them remained unaffected. They tenaciously survived until Year 21 of the New Calendar.
Yes, in the room owner’s memories, it was Year 21 of the New Calendar.
The people Shang Jianyao encountered in this psychological trauma seemed smart, capable of chatting, and had their own memories. However, they were inferior to the passengers from the cruise ship trauma. This was because once he diverted a topic too far due to his jumpy thoughts, not only would the people here be unable to answer, but they would also spout nonsense. It was incongruous.
According to this, Shang Jianyao determined that the reason they could ask, answer, and chat as if they were normal was that the room owner had spent a long time with them. From time to time, they would have all kinds of conversations that involved many things.
After these memories were subconsciously activated, they allowed the corresponding figures to look rather realistic.
“I still didn’t encounter any danger. I feel at ease as if I’m home.” The honest Shang Jianyao didn’t hide his confusion.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao deliberated for a moment and said, “Maybe the focus of this psychological trauma isn’t the courage to face danger, so there’s naturally no danger that lurks on the surface.”
The current psychological trauma didn’t exist in the strategy guide given by Pangu Biology. After all, in order not to affect Room 506’s owner, this place was used as a place for new Awakened to adapt to the explorations. Everyone followed the ‘rules.’ They would leave after clearing two psychological traumas at most.
Shang Jianyao suspected that he had skipped the second psychological trauma because he had taken an aberrant path in the first psychological trauma.
“Then, what should we do?” the rash Shang Jianyao blurted out. “We’ve already chatted with everyone, but apart from obtaining some information, we don’t have any clues.”
He was referring to the clues to clear this psychological trauma.
Zen Master Redemption was rather calm about this. “It’s fine if we can’t find it. At most, we’ll change to another room in the strategy guide.”
During the discussion, Shang Jianyao didn’t forget to observe his surroundings.
Coupled with the details he had noticed in his previous chats, he gradually discovered something abnormal: Nobody in this residential area approached the exit!
No matter how complicated their trajectories were, they didn’t enter that area.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao stroked his chin. “Is it because the room owner’s psychological trauma is at the exit that everyone here ‘subconsciously’ avoids it, or was there a rule that forbade people from approaching that area in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential zone back then?”
He didn’t wait for his other peers to join in the discussion and suddenly handed control over the body to the rash one.
The rash Shang Jianyao immediately turned around and walked to the exit.
The other Shang Jianyaos wanted to give it a try to see if they could trigger a beneficial change. They chose to agree tacitly one after another.
Only the ruthless one controlled his mouth and kept nagging. “Don’t be foolhardy just because we’re skilled! Don’t think that we won’t screw up in such a simple room just because we’ve cleared a psychological trauma that involves the Kalendaria. This is related to the Old World’s nine research institutes. It’s better to be careful!”
As he rambled, Shang Jianyao slowly approached the door.
It was calm.
He turned around and looked at the people in the residential area, only to realize that nobody was paying attention to him.
Shang Jianyao maintained his current posture and retreated step by step toward the sentry iron fence.
Suddenly, the people in the residential area—who were either enjoying the shade, busying themselves, or coming and going—cast their gazes over.
The white-haired old lady sitting on a stool under the tree revealed a terrified expression.
Some of the others were flustered, some were nervous, and some were angry as if Shang Jianyao had offended them. Some were filled with hatred and enmity as if they were using their gazes to say, “Why do you dare to do something we don’t dare to do?”
Rumble!
An explosion suddenly happened at the door. A ball of flames rose up with a plume of dust, turning into a gigantic mushroom.
Shang Jianyao pounced forward in advance and ‘conjured’ a military exoskeleton on him. With this object’s help, he jumped dozens of meters.
He wasn’t enveloped by the explosion, but his back still suffered the ravaging of the blast.
Bam!
Even with the military exoskeleton, Shang Jianyao couldn’t maintain his balance. He saw stars from the fall and felt like a few of his bones had fractured.
At the same time, the expressions of the people in the residential area changed again.
Their expressions were cold, and the muscles on their faces were stiff. There was no emotion in their eyes as if they had long died. However, they stared at the intruder that was attempting to disrupt their stable lives.
Upon seeing this, Shang Jianyao immediately shouted, “Don’t move!”
Wherever his voice reached, everyone stopped moving as if they were playing a game of Green Light, Red Light.
Thud! Thud! Thud!
Shang Jianyao—who was wearing a military exoskeleton—ran, his back stinging from the pain. Finally, he ran to the building he first appeared in.
With a single step, he left Room 506 and rushed into the corridor. He then lay on the thick, dark-yellow carpet without any regard for his image.
He spread his limbs and panted heavily.
After a while, the honest Shang Jianyao spat. “What a lack of morals! Why didn’t they warn us first and fire before bombarding us? How can a normal person bury a land mine of that level at the door? There are still people in charge of guarding that place!”
The ruthless Shang Jianyao scoffed. “This is a psychological trauma, and it’s not strictly comparable to reality. As long as the room owner has encountered or even only seen it, the corresponding matters might pile up in the same place. I told you to be careful, but none of you believed me!”
Zen Master Redemption replied calmly, “Namo Annutara-Samyak-Subhuti. We were only injured by the explosion and suffered some mental damage. It won’t be a problem.”
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao thoughtfully said, “I suspect that it’s not only the main entrance area that’s problematic. Anyone who tries to leave the residential area will encounter all kinds of danger. This is a reflection of the room owner’s corresponding fear.”
“Therefore, facing these dangers is considered clearing the psychological trauma?” The rash Shang Jianyao controlled his body and stood up with a look that said, “Let’s return now and get blown up a few more times.”
He was forcefully held down.
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao stroked his chin. “I have a nagging feeling that it won’t be that simple. Every psychological trauma’s corresponding fear is different. Just avoiding danger and escaping elsewhere is something we’ve already experienced. I think it’s safer to make more explorations to figure out this problem.”
“That’s right, that’s right.” The Shang Jianyao that always had no opinion agreed.
The ruthless Shang Jianyao stood on the side of the peer he hated the most.
Due to the fact that everyone had been blown up and was injured, requiring them to recover mentally, Shang Jianyao left the Mind Corridor and fell asleep.
…
349th floor, Zone C, Room 12.
As her parents had gone to a colleague’s house as guests, Jiang Baimian leisurely stayed in the study alone and browsed through some public information using her father’s account.
Having failed to find any interesting content, she took out the pattern on the copied Babymaker talisman. She opened the Old World folklore database she had established and tried to carry out a search and comparison.
For this reason, she also specially used a drawing tablet to outline the corresponding pattern.
There’s nothing that’s completely identical. Jiang Baimian busied herself for a while before looking at the computer screen and muttering to herself silently, I can only say that it looks similar from a cursory glance. In fact, it doesn’t follow the corresponding patterns. Of course, it’s also possible that my database isn’t perfect and has many missing ones.
After pondering for a while, Jiang Baimian deconstructed the pattern.
After deconstructing and restructuring it again and again, she frowned slightly.
From the simplest point of view, the pattern was made up of a woman and a baby. The two had some hieroglyphic meaning, but Jiang Baimian was very sure that they weren’t real hieroglyphic texts.
Jiang Baimian shook her head, planning to get more information from Long Yuehong’s inquiry tomorrow. A woman and a baby do seem to work in terms of meaning, but it doesn’t seem like much thought was put into it. It’s too simple…
…
The next morning, Room 14 on the 647th floor.
Long Yuehong recounted the information he had obtained from his grandmother and the corresponding feedback.
“Is it my turn next?” Although Shang Jianyao’s face was a little pale, he was still very excited.
“I guess so.” Long Yuehong suddenly hesitated.
Will it worsen the problem if we let this fellow probe? He has very special characteristics!
“Yes,” Bai Chen replied very firmly.
Jiang Baimian glanced at Shang Jianyao. “What’s wrong? Did you not sleep well last night?”
“Something happened when I was clearing Room 506’s psychological trauma. Fortunately, I’ll recover from my headache in two to three days; it won’t affect my usual usage of my abilities.” Shang Jianyao was rather honest.
Jiang Baimian chuckled. “You can even cause trouble in what’s publicly acknowledged as the simplest Room 506?”
“More trouble is conducive to obtaining more information.” The calm and rational Shang Jianyao skillfully changed the topic. “I’ve already confirmed that Room 506’s owner comes from the Fourth Research Institute.”
Jiang Baimian was immediately interested. “Is that so?”
After discussing this question for a while, Jiang Baimian thought for a moment and said, “I suspect that the key to this psychological trauma isn’t to storm out but something else. Its performance doesn’t seem to focus on danger. It might very well represent another kind of fear.”
Shang Jianyao nodded happily. “I think so too!”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
He applauded himself and Jiang Baimian.
The day passed uneventfully.. When it was almost time to knock off, the four Old Task Force members gathered together again and discussed the matter of Shang Jianyao requesting a Babymaker talisman.

On the 417th floor, Long Yuehong led Shang Jianyao to meet his grandmother, Zhong Zining, at the Rec Center.
At this moment, Zhong Zining was dancing and working out with a group of neighbors of varying ages.
Shang Jianyao’s eyes lit up when he saw this, eager to take off his coat and join in. To his frustration, the music stopped.
Zhong Zining wiped the sweat from her forehead with a towel wrapped around her shoulders and heard her eldest grandson shout for her.
As he walked toward the old lady, Shang Jianyao sighed with regret and envy at Long Yuehong. “Your grandmother’s floor is good at organizing activities. The Rec Center’s PIC here is too serious and responsible!”
I don’t like such music and dancing… As Long Yuehong muttered inwardly, he casually replied to Shang Jianyao, “If you find it good, you can apply for a room on this floor after you get married. With your rank, the higher-ups will definitely take your preferences into consideration.”
He didn’t say that, compared to his rank, they cared more about Shang Jianyao’s level as an Awakened.
Just as he said that, Long Yuehong softly grunted. He realized that with Shang Jianyao’s serious mental illness, it wouldn’t be a joyous matter regardless of who his assigned lady was unless the two parties had feelings for each other, allowing them to tolerate and accept each other as they went through thick and thin.
Upon seeing the two of them come over, Zhong Zining glanced at Shang Jianyao and said to Long Yuehong, “Is this the colleague you mentioned?”
Without waiting for Long Yuehong’s response, Shang Jianyao nodded obediently. “Hello, Grandma!”
“That’s right,” Long Yuehong quickly added.
“Mmm.” Zhong Zining nodded slightly and sized up Shang Jianyao for a while. As she recalled, she asked Long Yuehong, “He’s your classmate, right? I remember meeting him at your house. He came to play with you many times.”
“Yes, yes, yes. We were assigned to the same place,” Long Yuehong explained simply.
Zhong Zining smiled and enthusiastically asked Shang Jianyao, “When did you get married?”
“I don’t have a partner yet,” Shang Jianyao replied truthfully.
Long Yuehong couldn’t stop him in time.
This didn’t match the plan!
Zhong Zining was stunned. “Why are you asking for a Babymaker talisman when you don’t have a partner?”
Shang Jianyao replied in all seriousness, “Normally, one should request for a marriage talisman.”
Upon seeing Zhong Zining nod in agreement, he continued, “But after getting a marriage talisman and having a partner, won’t I have to request for a Babymaker talisman after marriage? And if I were to request for a Babymaker talisman directly, it’s impossible for me to have a child on my own, right? It’ll definitely have to give me a partner. Therefore, requesting a Babymaker talisman kills two birds with one stone!”
Zhong Zining was confused, but she felt that the other party made sense.
“That’s true.” She pointed at the Rec Center. “I’ll go back and change first. Then, I’ll lead you to the Mu family to request for the talisman.”
Shang Jianyao sincerely asked, “Granny, can I wait for you here?”
Long Yuehong’s grandparents lived in Zone C, so they still had to pass by the Rec Center to go to Zone B.
“Kid, are you embarrassed? Let me tell you something: Such a personality doesn’t benefit you when finding a partner.” Zhong Zining smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. Just wait here.”
She then said to Long Yuehong, “Entertain your friend well.”
After watching his grandmother leave the Rec Center, Long Yuehong frowned and suppressed his voice as he said to Shang Jianyao, “Did you use your abilities on my grandmother?”
Otherwise, how could she accept the idea of a single young man begging for a Babymaker talisman so easily?
“I didn’t?” Shang Jianyao had an innocent expression. “Your grandmother is very easy to talk to.”
Long Yuehong was just about to reply with ‘yes,’ when Shang Jianyao added, “Just like you.”
“…” Long Yuehong was immediately speechless.
After dozens of seconds, the music sounded again.
Shang Jianyao took off his coat, held it in his hand, and walked into the dancing crowd. For a moment, he felt like a fish in water as if he were back home.
So you didn’t go to my grandmother’s house because you wanted to take the opportunity to dance… Long Yuehong came to a realization.
After Zhong Zining returned after changing, Shang Jianyao walked out of the ‘dance floor’ reluctantly and put on his coat.
“You are quite rhythmic,” Zhong Zining praised. “Very few young people usually dance with us.”
“That’s because they have no taste and don’t know how to appreciate it.” Shang Jianyao spoke righteously.
This made Zhong Zining very happy, so much so that Long Yuehong felt a sense of danger that his status as eldest grandson was at risk. Therefore, he tried his best to change the topic.
As they chatted along the way, the three of them entered Zone B and arrived at Room 49.
Not only was the door tightly shut, but even the curtains were drawn.
At this moment, most of the doors to the surrounding rooms were open. People gathered on the streets to chat and kill time.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Zhong Zining knocked on Room 49’s door.
“Little Mu! Are you home?” she shouted as she knocked.
After about ten seconds, the door creaked open.
It was dim inside with only one lamp switched on. The space wasn’t considered spacious, only slightly larger than Shang Jianyao’s room. It could barely accommodate a family of three.
At this moment, there was only one person in the room—a woman in her thirties in old black clothes.
Her hair was messy, and her skin was slightly pale. The rest was fine; she was someone who had undergone genetic enhancement with above-average effects.
“You’re wasting energy! Why don’t you use the street lamps on the street?” Before Zhong Zining explained her intentions, Shang Jianyao advised her with a pained expression.
The woman was stunned. “Talismans have to be drawn in such an environment.”
“Oh, oh, oh.” Shang Jianyao immediately showed the respect afforded by a professional.
Zhong Zining glanced at him and smiled. “Little Mu, this is my eldest grandson’s colleague. He wants a Babymaker talisman. Ah… Where’s your husband and child?”
“He went to his father’s place. I have a few urgent talismans to make, so I didn’t go,” explained Mu casually. She then asked Shang Jianyao, “Is it urgent? If it’s urgent, it won’t fit into my timetable.”
We need to pay more… Long Yuehong—who was well-read in the Old World’s entertainment—added inwardly almost reflexively.
“No rush, no rush,” Shang Jianyao replied with a smile. “Auntie Mu, draw whenever you have the time.”
“Auntie…” Mu repeated the term with a nasty expression.
Hey, the one with high EQ should be out at a time like this! Long Yuehong resisted the urge to scratch his head. He had always felt that Shang Jianyao’s EQ was Schrodinger-like.
Zhong Zining laughed and helped introduce them. “This is Little Mu, Mu Qingqing. She’s only a few years older than you.”
Shang Jianyao oohed and aahed and smiled at Mu Qingqing. “Look, we were all born after the company’s genetic enhancement technology matured. You’re only a few years older than me. So…”
Mu Qingqing smiled and said, “Just call me Sister Mu. I’ve always been regretful that I don’t have a younger brother or sister.”
“…” Long Yuehong was dumbfounded. Only then did he realize that Shang Jianyao’s previous lack of EQ was to use Inference Clowning or Thought Guidance without anyone noticing.
How cunning! How cunning! Long Yuehong could only criticize inwardly.
After becoming Shang Jianyao’s sister, Mu Qingqing became much more enthusiastic. “Wait here then. I’ll draw it for you now.”
Zhong Zining—who was watching—explained, “See? Little Mu is a nice person.”
Long Yuehong took the opportunity to say to Zhong Zining, “Granny, now that it’s done, we won’t trouble you any more. We’ll wait. You can head back to the Rec Center to dance.”
He was afraid that the subsequent ‘conversation’ would be too terrifying and end up scaring his grandmother or that she would be embroiled in danger.
Zhong Zining was indeed concerned about her friends at the Rec Center. She didn’t stand on ceremony. After exhorting Long Yuehong, she turned around and walked out of the room.
Shang Jianyao smiled at Mu Qingqing. “Sister Mu, was your talisman drawing skills inherited from your ancestors?”
“Yes, my great-grandfather was a Daoist priest, and his lineage was passed down.” Mu Qingqing combed her messy hair.
Shang Jianyao asked with bright eyes, “Are these talismans really useful?”
Mu Qingqing hesitated and stammered, “It’s effective if you believe in it.”
“Really?” Shang Jianyao pressed.
Mu Qingqing felt that she shouldn’t lie to her brother. After hesitating for a moment, she said, “It might’ve been effective in the past, but it’s hard to say now.”
“Why?” Long Yuehong interrupted in surprise.
Mu Qingqing scratched her head and said in embarrassment, “I wasn’t too interested and didn’t learn it seriously when my father taught me how to draw the symbols. After I realized that I could earn a lot of additional contribution points with this, I realized that I couldn’t remember what the real patterns looked like. I could only redesign it according to my impression of it and try my best to make the process seem mysterious…”
Long Yuehong’s expression froze, and the corners of his mouth twitched. Your scrawls are not bad…
Shang Jianyao stroked his chin. “Sister Mu, why didn’t you learn from Uncle again? Why did you have to design it yourself?”
That’s right… Long Yuehong snapped to his senses.
Mu Qingqing let out a long sigh. “Your uncle passed away five years ago.”
“Sigh… My condolences.” Shang Jianyao was very sincere. He then casually asked, “Uncle shouldn’t be too old five years ago. How did he pass away?”
Based on Mu Qingqing’s age, her father was at most in his fifties five years ago. With Pangu Biology’s current conditions, it wasn’t unlikely for old employees to live to the age of 60 or 70, just like Long Yuehong’s grandparents.
Mu Qingqing revealed a mournful expression. “This might be fate. He suddenly had a myocardial infarction and couldn’t be resuscitated.”
Myocardial infarction… Long Yuehong’s pupils suddenly dilated.

On the 647th floor, Room 14.
Jiang Baimian—who had specially stayed behind to work overtime—sat up straight and cast her gaze at the door.
Bai Chen—who was also waiting for news in the office—sensed the commotion and also changed her sitting posture.
After a while, they heard footsteps.
Shang Jianyao and Long Yuehong quickly appeared at the door.
Jiang Baimian sensed the corridor and confirmed that nobody else was passing by before asking, “How was it?”
Shang Jianyao spread his arms slightly and smiled. “Good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?”
There’s good news? Long Yuehong—who was beside him—was the first to be confused.
After Mu Qingqing said that her father had died from a myocardial infarction five years ago, Shang Jianyao consoled her as if he could empathize. He then changed the topic and stopped talking about such matters.
After the Babymaker talisman was done, they directly went to the Rec Center to find an electronic device and completed the contribution point transaction. The entire process went by uneventfully.
Therefore, where did the good news come from?
“Let’s hear the good news first.” Bai Chen examined Shang Jianyao’s face for a few seconds but didn’t find any signs of ‘something serious’ or ‘something major.’
Jiang Baimian nodded in agreement.
Shang Jianyao maintained his smile and said, “The good news is that Little Red’s parents, grandparents, siblings, and uncles have nothing to do with strange religions. The talisman drawer, Mu Qingqing, is also fine.”
That’s right! This is indeed good news! Long Yuehong snapped back to reality from the shock of Mu Qingqing’s father dying of a myocardial infarction. As he came to a realization, he felt happy.
He found his original intention in dealing with this matter: It was to keep his family away from trouble!
Since the trouble itself didn’t exist, his goal had definitely been achieved.
“Yes, pretty good.” Jiang Baimian cast a look of congratulations at Long Yuehong.
Bai Chen didn’t hide her joy either.
“What about the bad news?” Jiang Baimian felt that the good news didn’t seem to contain any bad news.
Shang Jianyao’s expression turned serious. “Mu Qingqing’s father—the person who taught her how to draw those symbols—died from a myocardial infarction five years ago.”
“Myocardial infarction?” Jiang Baimian’s expression turned solemn.
Heart problems always reminded her of the Kalendaria, Arbiter of Fate. One of the organizations that worshiped the Arbiter of Fate was the Life Ritual parish.
They had once caused many cardiac arrests in Pangu Biology and killed many people. Furthermore, they seemed to be capable of directing the spread of the Heartless disease. This made Jiang Baimian—who increasingly knew about the Heartless disease—suspect that this parish had a powerhouse at the New World level!
Bai Chen pursed her lips and said, “Could it be a simple accident?”
Myocardial infarctions happened every year, and it was somewhat different from cardiac arrests.
“That requires further investigation.” Long Yuehong didn’t dare to be careless. After all, Mu Qingqing lived on the same floor as his grandparents.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “Mu Qingqing’s father knows how to draw a real Babymaker talisman.”
“What do you mean by ‘real Babymaker talisman?’” Jiang Baimian asked in confusion.
Shang Jianyao recounted how Mu Qingqing wasn’t serious when she was learning talismans back then and could only make them up now. Finally, he said in pain, “This story tells us that one who misspends his youth will grieve in vain in old age!”
Jiang Baimian wanted to laugh, but she felt that she shouldn’t. “I was wondering why it was so simple and direct after I deconstructed the pattern.”
It turned out that it was only fabricated based on impression. It was limited by Mu Qingqing’s knowledge and imagination!
If this were handed to Shang Jianyao, he might be able to draw some creative and corruptive talisman with his knowledge of the Old World’s entertainment and train of thought.
Jiang Baimian then recalled the Blessings from all Kalendarium and wavered in her thoughts.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao took out the newly obtained talisman and sighed. “Unfortunately, this isn’t the real one.”
“And the real one will work?” Jiang Baimian asked in amusement.
She had also found many items related to the Old World’s folklore over the years, but she didn’t discover any that were truly magical. In comparison, things that involved the Kalendarium were more or less a little special.
“Who knows?” Shang Jianyao walked to the sofa and sat down. “Maybe it’s because people of the same trade seldom agree. The Babymaker talisman is indeed effective; that’s why Mu Qingqing’s father was killed by the Life Ritual parish.”
Long Yuehong didn’t agree with this guess. “If it really worked, they wouldn’t have waited until five years ago.”
Mu Qingqing’s ancestors were in this line of work, starting with her great-grandfather. It wasn’t like her father had only started drawing talismans for people five years ago.
Shang Jianyao replied confidently, “Maybe the Life Ritual faith was introduced to the company five to six years ago.”
“Yes, although the matter regarding the Life Ritual parish has been resolved, I have a nagging feeling that it hasn’t really ended. There should still be many of them lurking in the company.” Long Yuehong recalled the past.
Back then, a supervisor of the surveillance department pleaded guilty by committing suicide, severing all the clues. The Security Department’s deputy minister, Xenny, was worried that the Old Task Force would subsequently suffer revenge, so she also specially arranged for them to go out on missions to avoid the most dangerous period.
After the Old Task Force returned, there were no further developments.
Of course, the higher-ups claimed that it had been resolved. As for how it was resolved, the Old Task Force had no way of knowing without the corresponding clearance.
Shang Jianyao scoffed at Long Yuehong. “The Awakened who wiped away a portion of my memories hasn’t been captured yet. It definitely isn’t over!”
Without waiting for Jiang Baimian and the others to join in the discussion, he continued, “Back when I was in the Life Ritual parish, they didn’t give anything like the Babymaker talisman. They only said during the sermon that a couple should have feelings for one another, have sufficient preparation, bodies and minds reconciled…
“Eh, I wonder if the Arbiter of Fate has the ability to help people get pregnant. When the time comes, just drawing a talisman and fusing one’s aura into it before carrying it around will lead to a side effect of pregnancy. Be it men or women, they will get pregnant regardless of their corresponding actions…”
“Stop, stop, stop!” Jiang Baimian stopped his wild imagination.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen looked like they had been tainted.
Jiang Baimian exhaled and pulled the topic back on track. “I’ll go home later to investigate Mu Qingqing’s father’s death.”
Bai Chen frowned. “Will this be dangerous? After what happened last time, will the Life Ritual parish recruit a batch of believers to the Internet Surveillance Department?”
As someone who could only use the Internet in the office, she didn’t know which department was in charge of such matters.
“If the Life Ritual parish really has a New World powerhouse in the company, they can control electromagnetism and directly hack into the network.” Shang Jianyao revealed an expression that was usually used to threaten Long Yuehong. “Wu Meng can do it.”
Jiang Baimian replied in amusement, “The company still has a certain level of network security. Even if Wu Meng comes, he won’t be able to hack into it easily unless he has hacking knowledge and abilities. Besides, how can New World powerhouses stay in reality and monitor the company’s network all the time?”
With that said, Jiang Baimian nodded slightly. “However, we do need to pay attention. The Life Ritual parish used to control cameras, so they might be able to monitor the Internet now.”
She then laughed. “Don’t worry. The last time we investigated the Life Ritual parish, the relevant departments pulled out a list of people who had died from cardiac causes in the past decade and did a certain level of investigation. I later got a copy on my home computer using my connections.
“Although I’m not sure why they don’t think there’s anything wrong with Mu Qingqing’s father’s death, this doesn’t stop me from doing another check. Heh heh, I’ll disconnect my Internet when reading.”
“Be careful.” Bai Chen nodded.
Just as she said that, Shang Jianyao slapped his thigh. “I forgot something!”
“What?” Everyone became nervous, wondering if Shang Jianyao had previously discovered a more direct clue. However, they didn’t think in the direction of the Life Ritual parish.
Shang Jianyao sighed. “Didn’t Director Su get me to organize information on the newly explored rooms? I forgot.”
Impressive. You don’t even take a director’s words seriously… Long Yuehong didn’t know whether to give Shang Jianyao a thumbs up or shun him.
“Then, organize it later.” Jiang Baimian was accustomed to Shang Jianyao’s jumpy train of thought.
Shang Jianyao nodded. “I’ll request the reward after submission to be the installation of a phone in my room.”
“Why do you want to install a phone?” Jiang Baimian asked in confusion.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen were confused.
Shang Jianyao seriously answered Jiang Baimian’s question. “This way, you can call me when you are disconnected from the Internet to read the information. I’ll use my electromagnetic interference to help you guard against any accidents.”
You… came back to the topic? Jiang Baimian was a little stunned.
Long Yuehong thought for a moment and said to Shang Jianyao, “I think the company might directly switch you to a room with a telephone.”
Shang Jianyao was important enough.
“No!” Shang Jianyao firmly rejected it. “We haven’t succeeded in saving all of humanity. How can we switch for a better room?”
The office fell silent.
After a few seconds, Jiang Baimian pinched her cheek. “Actually, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. We have a phone in our office; you can stay here until lights out.”
“That’s right!” Shang Jianyao had a ‘you’re really smart’ expression.
At this moment, Long Yuehong thought for a moment and said, “Why don’t we report it directly?”
Jiang Baimian exhaled silently. “There might be people from the Life Ritual parish hiding above. If we can’t ‘determine’ the clues in advance, it’s very likely that they will destroy them, just like the Surveillance Department’s PIC—who committed suicide previously.”
“Okay.” Long Yuehong and Bai Chen nodded.
Jiang Baimian then said, “Oh right, the rewards should be distributed tomorrow.”
Shang Jianyao, Long Yuehong, and Bai Chen’s eyes more or less lit up.
…
Jiang Baimian returned home on the 349th floor, Zone C, Room 12. After greeting her parents, she slipped into the study.
She switched on the computer, entered the corresponding drive, and disconnected from the Internet.. After hesitating for a moment, she picked up the phone in the room and dialed a number
Chapter 762: Phone Call

Ding ring ring!
The telephone in Room 14 on the 647th floor rang.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao was sitting on Jiang Baimian’s high-back chair without any reservation. He fidgeted around or spun in the chair at random.
He reached out to pick up the receiver, brought it to his ear, and said eloquently, “Hello, this is the Security Department’s Room 14 on the 647th floor. Exact operation teams are confidential. Is there anything?”
On the other end of the line, Jiang Baimian cursed in exasperation and amusement. “You’re just making it obvious that you are hiding something!”
“That’s right, that’s right. You’re right.” Shang Jianyao readily agreed.
Jiang Baimian didn’t waste her breath and restrained her expression. “Then, I’ll get to work.”
Due to the fact that phones could also be monitored, Jiang Baimian had repeatedly reminded Shang Jianyao not to chat or mention that they were investigating the death of Mu Qingqing’s father when they discussed it face-to-face in the office. When he heard the word ‘work,’ he needed to provide help based on the original agreement.
“Alright.” Shang Jianyao focused and spread his psyche. With the phone’s structure and electromagnetic spread, he affected the environment around Jiang Baimian.
Of course, this influence was very weak; it was only effective if the nearby targets simultaneously heard Shang Jianyao’s words. This was how Thought Guidance could be used in its state. On the other hand, Corny Person, Literary Hipster, and Limbs Immobility couldn’t be used.
With this weak influence, Shang Jianyao could still sense human consciousness up to a certain range. If anything happened to Jiang Baimian, he could provide help immediately.
After an intense discussion by the Shang Jianyao Democratic Association, they had already thought of a way to help: It was to beg for mercy loudly and sincerely on Jiang Baimian’s behalf.
“I was wrong. I won’t do it again. Spare me!”
If it were anyone else, such an apology would definitely be useless and would instead waste the precious time they had to save Jiang Baimian. However, Shang Jianyao was different. Under Thought Guidance, the enemy would sincerely accept the apology and believe that they would never dare to do so again. The other party would believe that they had accomplished the same silencing effect and not pursue the matter.
Jiang Baimian’s evaluation when she heard of this solution was: Although this was a little ridiculous, comical, and funny, it was fine as long as it was useful!
Of course, ‘begging’ was a backup plan. It was closer to a joke because a timely solution was to shout simple words like ‘stop.’
Shang Jianyao would only consider ‘begging’ unless Thought Guidance—which lacked the prerequisites—wasn’t effective.
Jiang Baimian held the receiver in one hand and listened to Shang Jianyao’s breathing. She didn’t miss any warning that might be transmitted as she controlled the mouse with the other hand and clicked open the saved document.
This was a list of people who had died from cardiac complications in Pangu Biology over the past decade. Behind each person was a preliminary report and investigation conclusion.
There were relatively few people with the surname ‘Mu.’ Among those with the surname ‘Mu,’ there were even fewer people who had a heart problem and couldn’t be resuscitated in the past decade. There was only one person, and Jiang Baimian easily found the target by scanning with her finger: Mu Renjie.
This person’s age and the year of the death matched Mu Qingqing’s father’s identity.
Jiang Baimian clicked on the corresponding preliminary report and investigation results.
The preliminary report showed that on September 30, five years ago, Mu Renjie—who lived in Zone A on the 417th floor—woke up in the middle of the night and headed to the nearest public bathroom. On the way, he suddenly fell to the ground and shouted for help to no avail.
It was late at night, and nobody sensed this. By the time the other neighbors passed by en route to the public bathroom, they found Mu Renjie already dead.
After an autopsy, the cause of death was confirmed to be myocardial infarction.
The preliminary report also mentioned that the Order Supervisory Department had sent people to investigate the surveillance cameras back then and didn’t discover any attack on Mu Renjie.
Nobody passed by the surrounding area when he fainted.
This preliminary report was written more than five years ago, and the surveillance footage in Pangu Biology was stored for only three years. The last investigation was nearly two years ago. Therefore, there was footage to be reviewed. They could only determine that there was nothing wrong with the report, the subsequent summary of social connections, and the cardiac problems on the corresponding floor.
The summary of the social connections during the last investigation was that Mu Renjie didn’t have any major conflicts with anyone when he was alive. Apart from Mu Renjie, nobody on the 417th floor died from a cardiac disease that year.
After Jiang Baimian finished reading it, she held the receiver and muttered to herself, “There aren’t any problems.”
If one only looked at the preliminary report and the investigation results, Mu Renjie’s death was purely an accident or a result of fate.
“The biggest problem is that there’s nothing wrong,” Shang Jianyao replied seriously on the other end of the line.
Jiang Baimian chuckled. “What’s the reason?”
“There’s no reason.” Shang Jianyao spoke firmly despite being very unconvincing.
After answering, he lowered his voice and weakly said, “I just find it a little coincidental.”
“Why don’t you say that he suffered such a fate because he didn’t have a good name, a sad life, or had done something that involves fate?” Jiang Baimian deliberately changed the topic, planning to have a detailed chat in the office tomorrow in the event the phone was being monitored.
Smack!
Shang Jianyao slapped his thigh. “That’s indeed a possibility!”
Jiang Baimian didn’t give him a chance to think before saying, “Are you still going to explore Room 506’s psychological trauma tonight?”
“I’ll take a break for one day. My head hurts a little,” Shang Jianyao replied honestly.
He had previously been injured by an explosion in the psychological trauma and needed to recover from the mental damage. However, it wasn’t serious. A day or two of good sleep could resolve it.
Jiang Baimian tersely acknowledged it. “Tell me more about the psychological trauma. Let’s figure out where the key lies.”
“Alright.” Shang Jianyao readily agreed.
After he recounted his experience in the psychological trauma in detail and she gave him some guesses, Jiang Baimian pondered for a moment and said, “You’re right about one thing. The room owner should’ve lived in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area for a long time. This resulted in him interacting with most of the people there and chatting about all kinds of things.”
It was only in this way that Shang Jianyao and the others would appear very real when chatting with those people. They could ask and answer questions. Once they exceeded a certain range, they became incongruous; they wouldn’t even know what they were saying.
“That’s right, that’s right.” Shang Jianyao agreed.
Jiang Baimian continued, “Besides, this psychological trauma has a very calm, peaceful, and peaceful surface. As long as you don’t approach the door, you won’t be attacked. Coupled with our previous guess, can we believe that the room owner has feelings for the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area?”
“No wonder I feel like I’m home.” Shang Jianyao stroked his chin.
“That’s… pretty direct.” Jiang Baimian couldn’t help but laugh. She then exhaled and asked, “Then, what’s your greatest fear for your home?”
“Losing it,” Shang Jianyao replied without hesitation.
Jiang Baimian held the receiver and nodded slightly. “When you rushed through the main entrance, the expressions of the people in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area changed. Their cold and merciless attitude after the explosion gave me a guess: The psychological trauma of the room owner is that he did something, lost his hometown, and was unanimously abandoned by the people who formed his hometown. Charging out the door is a symbol of such an action. Therefore, the explosion is sudden, chaotic, and filled with destructive tendencies.”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped by slamming the desk. He then seriously asked, “How should I clear such a psychological trauma? I’m afraid that facing danger with courage won’t do.”
Jiang Baimian deliberated for a moment and said, “Try having the courage to face painful memories? This matches the personality displayed by the room owner in other psychological traumas.”
“I understand.” Shang Jianyao wasn’t excited. Instead, he was filled with emotion. “Some things can only be resolved by tearing open that wound and looking at the bloody situation directly, cleaning up the pus inside.”
How philosophical… Jiang Baimian was just about to elaborate when she suddenly heard a knock on the door.
“Who is it?” she asked as she turned her body.
“Who do you think it is? There are only a few people at home!” Jiang Baimian’s mother, Xue Sumei, pushed open the door. “I sliced you some apples.”
She held a small plate with sliced apples and a small fork.
I didn’t say I wanted to eat it… Jiang Baimian muttered inwardly and smiled. “A mother knows her daughter best. How did you know that I happened to want to eat fruits?”
“Do you think I don’t understand you?” After Xue Sumei put down the plate, she casually asked, “Who were you on the call with? And for so long?”
Jiang Baimian frankly replied, “A colleague; I was asking about something.”
“Oh.” Xue Sumei didn’t ask any further. She turned around and walked out of the study.
…
The next morning, Jiang Baimian—who was the last to arrive at the office despite setting off early—recounted what she had found out last night and asked, “Any thoughts?”
“I think we can bring the matter to a close.” Bai Chen pursed her lips and said, “Since it doesn’t involve Little Red’s grandparents, we’ll pretend that nothing happened. On the one hand, this might very well be a coincidence. On the other hand, even if it really involves the Life Ritual parish, it won’t affect us if we hide away and don’t involve ourselves. If they really wanted revenge, they would’ve long taken action.”
“With a precedent, it’s quite difficult for such a secret religion to expand under the company’s nose,” echoed Long Yuehong.
Shang Jianyao laughed and didn’t comment.. He stroked his chin and said, “I’m wondering where the murderer would’ve been if Mu Qingqing’s father’s death was really artificial.”

Jiang Baimian didn’t answer Shang Jianyao’s question. Instead, she looked at Long Yuehong and gave him the opportunity to analyze the situation.
Long Yuehong thought for a moment before saying, “Excluding the possibility that the surveillance footage back then was faked, the murderer should be hiding in a room around that route. If he’s only at the Sea of Origins level, just searching the rooms on both sides of the route would suffice. If he had entered the Mind Corridor, we’d have to include the rooms on the other nearby streets in our search range.”
The route referred to the route Mu Qingqing’s father—Mu Renjie—took from home to the nearest public bathroom. It started with his house and ended at the spot where he fell to the ground.
“Why must we eliminate the possibility that the surveillance footage is faked?” Shang Jianyao asked in an unconventional manner.
Long Yuehong frowned. “The risk of being discovered while doing so is too high. The Life Ritual parish didn’t do so back when they executed their divine punishment either. From a path dependence perspective, if they had used this method to modify the surveillance footage and it was effective, they would’ve done the same back then.”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped
Bai Chen smiled with a nod.
This inflated Long Yuehong’s confidence, and he quickly added, “Besides, the surveillance footage has been deleted. There’s no way to confirm its authenticity. The original surveillance department’s PIC also hanged himself because it involved the Life Ritual parish. The dead can’t testify, so there’s no way to investigate. We can only temporarily treat the surveillance footage as real.”
“Then, why don’t you include the rooms on the same route on the floors above and below?” Shang Jianyao asked. “The range of Awakened abilities isn’t solely two-dimensional.”
Long Yuehong organized his words and said, “I just think that the probability of a precise lock is unlikely when there’s a floor in between them, resulting in vision obstruction. Due to the same reason, the probability of the murderer hiding in other rooms on other streets isn’t high either. What if it was Mu Renjie’s wife who went to the public bathroom that night?”
“Then, she might be the one dying.” Shang Jianyao sneered.
Hiss… A few words suddenly appeared in Long Yuehong’s mind: indiscriminate killing!
“Wait!” He suddenly snapped to his senses. “We associate Mu Renjie’s death with the Life Ritual parish because he died of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, he had inherited the Old World’s talisman tradition and had drawn many Babymaker talismans. His wife doesn’t meet the conditions at all.”
If it was indiscriminate killing, all the Old Task Force’s previous inferences would be wrong. They wouldn’t be able to connect it to the Life Ritual parish at all.
Jiang Baimian nodded slightly. Just as she was about to comment, Shang Jianyao raised another possibility. “Maybe someone implanted the corresponding thoughts in Mu Renjie in advance, so he will definitely go to the public bathroom at that time. That way, it will be very easy to lock onto him. It’s impossible that his wife happened to go to the public bathroom at the same time, right?”
“Isn’t this too complicated?” Long Yuehong expressed his doubts.
It wasn’t like Mu Renjie was a powerful character.
“It’s not complicated.” Shang Jianyao laughed. “When you lived in Little White’s room that day, you woke up at three in the morning and went to the public bathroom. It was because I implanted the corresponding thoughts in you.”
The one—who liked to joke and prank—appeared smug.
“…” Long Yuehong gaped. “So it’s you! Didn’t you say that you couldn’t be bothered to use your Awakened abilities on me?”
Shang Jianyao shrugged. “We definitely won’t do anything when it’s something serious, but it’s fine for pulling your leg.”
Bai Chen joined the discussion. “I think you’re wrong. If one can implant a certain thought into Mu Renjie in advance, there are more and better ways to make him die silently without creating any suspicion.”
“Yes, it can be completely done. For example, he might accidentally electrocute himself to death while fixing the light bulb at home,” Shang Jianyao replied without stuttering as if he wasn’t the one who had suggested the possibility of Thought Implantation.
Long Yuehong was confused. “Then, why did you say that Mu Renjie might’ve had the corresponding thoughts implanted in him in advance?”
“Isn’t this to lure out the fact that I once implanted a thought in you so that you can go to the bathroom in the middle of the night?” Shang Jianyao replied righteously. “It would be boring if the target didn’t know that I had pulled a prank!”
The Hey that is cheerful and likes to joke is essentially a nasty fellow… Jiang Baimian commented. She then concluded, “As long as letting the target die from a heart problem isn’t a ritual insisted by the Life Ritual parish, the problem is that the rooms on both sides of the corresponding route are most likely the problem.
“This involves dozens to a hundred people. Some of them later changed rooms and went to other floors because of their marriage. It’s very difficult to investigate them one by one. It needs to be done in concert with the company.”
Once they reported it to the company, the hidden Life Ritual parish members might intercept the information in advance and eliminate any clues.
Shang Jianyao thought for a moment before his eyes suddenly lit up. “Why don’t I invade the radio station, disguise myself as Hou Yi, and implant Thought Guidance in a piece of news? I can currently affect more than 100 targets at the same time. It’s just enough to investigate everyone along that route.”
The corners of Jiang Baimian’s mouth twitched. “How much do you want to invade the radio station?”
How many times has this been suggested!?
She then doused Shang Jianyao’s enthusiasm. “Also, how do you disguise yourself as Hou Yi?”
Shang Jianyao was stunned for a few seconds before sighing. “It would be good if Old Ge were here. We can get him to handcraft a voice changer.”
Can Old Ge’s handcrafted work really be considered handcrafted? Long Yuehong suddenly had this question.
Jiang Baimian exhaled and said, “The easiest solution is to request a meeting with Director Su when you submit the report and have a chat with him about Mu Renjie so that he can organize the subsequent investigations. If the Board of Directors really has Life Ritual parishioners, we don’t have to put in any more effort. Let’s just baptize ourselves and wait to believe in the Arbiter of Fate.”
Shang Jianyao nodded, stretched out his hands, and gently rocked a baby in his arms. He then said loudly, “The End will belong to the Arbiter of Fate!”
Jiang Baimian rolled her eyes at him before asking in amusement, “I remember you saying that the End will belong to the Arbiter of Fate when life passes on. Isn’t this inauspicious?”
“Don’t mind such details.” Shang Jianyao quickly changed the topic. “I’ll begin writing the report when the computers are back.”
As he temporarily didn’t have to get a phone installed in his room, he slacked off again.
In the afternoon, the items that the Old Task Force had previously obtained completed the review and were distributed. They also received their rewards.
Jiang Baimian remained a D9 and had yet to enter management. However, the higher-ups hinted that she would be promoted to M1 when she finished exploring the last Buddhist Holy Land, found the Eighth Research Institute’s true location, or the whereabouts of Shang Jianyao’s father’s Old Task Force. She would then be on the same level as her father, Jiang Wenfeng.
Shang Jianyao and Long Yuehong both reached D8, and Bai Chen was D7.
In addition to the promotion of their rank and their field allowance, each of them received a reward of 30,000 contribution points.
My basic salary now is 5,300 points a month, and my allowance is 1,300 points. Little White’s basic salary is 4,800 points, and her allowance is 1,100 points. Together, we can receive 12,500 contribution points a month… Long Yuehong instinctively calculated in his heart.
This income was about seven times that of when he first started working. It was enough to support a family of four that had meat every meal with frequent opportunities to eat fruits and snacks.
Coupled with the large room that was definitely assigned to him and Bai Chen based on their ranks, Long Yuehong couldn’t help but curl the corners of his mouth when he thought of the future.
Upon seeing this, Jiang Baimian smiled and teased, “It’s Sunday in two days. Do you want to practice the parent-meeting session in advance?”
“That’s right, that’s right!” Shang Jianyao was excited.
“Uh…” Although Long Yuehong didn’t think it required practice, he still wasn’t confident. After all, this was the first time he brought his future wife home.
“Alright,” Bai Chen replied very seriously.
Jiang Baimian smiled. “There’s no need for practice, but I can tell you of things to take note of.”
“Okay, okay.” Bai Chen didn’t refuse.
Shang Jianyao immediately had a look of disappointment and regret.
“What’s with that expression?” Jiang Baimian glared at him.
Shang Jianyao sighed. “If we really want to practice, we definitely have to find someone to act as Little Red’s father.”
Long Yuehong suddenly felt like he had escaped disaster.
…
495th floor, Zone B, Room 196.
Shang Jianyao returned home. Upon seeing that it was still early, he lay on the bed and entered the Mind Corridor.
He pushed open Room 506’s door and walked in.
The Fourth Research Institute’s residential area surfaced in front of him.
There were many buildings here, and trees were everywhere. Most of the people coming and going knew each other and often stopped to chat. The atmosphere was serene and peaceful.
Shang Jianyao casually walked and realized that this psychological trauma had returned to the state he was in when he first entered. This was the most normal situation, an extremely special example like the cruise ship trauma.
After circling around and meeting many people, Shang Jianyao stroked his chin and muttered to himself, “How should I face painful memories?”
“It’s very simple. Fall out with the people here first!” The rash Shang Jianyao suggested.
After a round of ‘discussion,’ the Shang Jianyaos decided to give it a try first.
He slowly walked to the main gates, just a meter away from the spot where he had been injured from the explosion. Shang Jianyao then conjured a military exoskeleton and prepared himself.
He jumped into the danger zone and suddenly jumped back as though swinging himself on the edge of the ‘cliff.’
A dull boom instantly sounded.
This time, it wasn’t an explosion. The entire ground cracked, and crimson magma surged out.
Shang Jianyao barely dodged it and rolled back to safety. He then shouted excitedly, “The room owner has seen a volcanic eruption before!”
At this moment, the expressions of the people in the residential area turned cold like emotionless corpses.
Shang Jianyao straightened his body and walked over with a smile.
He wanted to see how the painful memories affected him!

Shang Jianyao looked at the residents in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area with stiff and cold expressions that left one apprehensive. He then strode over.
Behind him, thick smoke spewed out, and redness flowed. The entire entrance had become an abnormally active volcanic crater, but it didn’t affect any plants or trees in the residential area.
The two seemed to be in different worlds.
Shang Jianyao’s first target was the white-haired old lady sitting under the tree, who he had previously chatted with.
Just as he approached and before he could speak, the old lady stood up with a cold and slightly abhorrent expression and took two steps back.
Bang!
A puncture wound suddenly appeared on Shang Jianyao’s chest!
This came from a shot, but he didn’t detect its source. The military exoskeleton’s comprehensive warning system didn’t react at all. The bullet seemed to have appeared out of thin air, and it originated from the rules. It was destined to hit and couldn’t be dodged.
Shang Jianyao slowly lowered his head and looked at his chest.
It was gushing red amid mangled flesh. He could vaguely see his expanding and contracting heart.
This shot made Shang Jianyao feel intense pain from his heart, but miraculously, the injury wasn’t fatal despite being very serious.
The honest Shang Jianyao muttered, “Can you make any sense? I’m wearing a military exoskeleton and have bulletproof armor protecting my chest. How can I be penetrated by a single shot and collapse so easily? Even a Gauss rifle can’t do it that easily!”
He then stroked his chin. “Could this be the so-called ‘heart-breaking’ strike?”
The Shang Jianyao that sought novelty popped his head from the side and came to a realization. “This is because we are acting as the room owner and are hated by the old lady in front of us. It’s as if the corresponding memories were evoked after they saw an unwelcome stranger, and the hidden psychological trauma surged out. Therefore, the feelings of being sad essentially manifested as a heart-breaking gunshot to the heart. Emotional trauma is something that a military exoskeleton can’t block. Furthermore, there are no warning signs. Once it happens, there will be an immediate reaction.”
This was a psychological trauma. Many things didn’t follow logic, and many things that happened were more symbolic.
The ruthless Shang Jianyao immediately scoffed. “Isn’t the room owner’s mental fortitude too weak? He got heart-broken just like that?”
He opened a mouth on the forehead.
The honest Shang Jianyao couldn’t seize control of the body and could only respond from his other shoulder. “Otherwise, why would it evolve into a psychological trauma?”
The calm and rational Shang Jianyao nodded thoughtfully. “If that’s the case, Big White’s guess is right. This psychological trauma is actually the room owner’s painful memories of being abandoned, hated, and ostracized by all his acquaintances and even some of his family.”
“Let’s confirm it again. I think we can still withstand two to three more ‘heart-breaks.’” Shang Jianyao—who sought novelty—eagerly cast his gaze at the middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses.
The other Shang Jianyaos shrank back to avoid scaring the target and affecting the experiment’s effects.
The Shang Jianyao that sought novelty walked to the middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses. He pushed up his visor and smiled.
The middle-aged man’s cold and emotionless face suddenly warped as he shouted hysterically, “F*ck off!”
With a sizzling sound, Shang Jianyao’s abdomen—which was protected by the military exoskeleton—was sliced open. His armor and flesh were sliced open, and his bloody guts gushed out. Some of them were already in pieces.
Zen Master Redemption replaced the Shang Jianyao who sought novelty and sighed. “Namo Annutara-Samyak-Subhuti. This is ‘gut-wrenching.’”
“Ah, I won’t complain even if it’s gut-wrenching…” The Shang Jianyao who sought novelty and loved singing and dancing seized the initiative.
The ruthless but timid Shang Jianyao finally couldn’t help but make a mouth on his forehead again and urged, “Can you guys treat the wounds? Doesn’t it hurt?”
Heart-breaking and gut-wrenching were high on the pain scale.
“Then, I’ll leave it to you!” The Shang Jianyao who sought novelty gave up control over the body immediately.
After treating his wound, Shang Jianyao stroked his chin and muttered to himself, “We can now basically confirm that this psychological trauma is essentially the room owner’s painful memories of being abandoned. But facing the pain directly seems dangerous. There’s a high chance we’ll die here if we take another two more times of damage equivalent to ‘heart-breaks’ and ‘gut-wrenching.’”
In reality, he would become a vegetable.
“Let’s try something else first.” The timid Shang Jianyao didn’t want to suffer another ‘heartbreaking’ or ‘gut-wrenching’ damage.
“That’s right, that’s right.” The Shang Jianyao who always echoed agreed immediately.
The Shang Jianyao that valued relationships but was still a child mentally was more afraid of pain. He also felt that they couldn’t rashly endure the pain.
After a round of communication, they suppressed Zen Master Redemption—who had a self-sacrificial spirit—and the rash Shang Jianyao. They decided to think of another way.
The Shang Jianyao that liked to joke chuckled and said, “Since the room owner’s psychological trauma was of him being abandoned, hated, and ostracized by the people here, can’t we just let him be accepted again? This is what we’re good at!”
“Let’s give it a try.” The calm and rational Shang Jianyao agreed with this plan.
They pressed their palms together and used the loudspeaker attached to the military exoskeleton to shout at the middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses and the other 100-plus people not far away. “We’ve been together for so many years; shouldn’t there be some feelings for one another? I know you guys have your difficulties, and I don’t blame you. I can accept it. I hope you can also abandon those unpleasant memories and allow us to return to the past…”
He directly used Thought Implantation.
In order to allow Thought Implantation to produce sufficient effects, he played the emotional card of them knowing each other for so long.
The middle-aged man in gold-rimmed glasses and the nearby 100-plus people gradually smiled.
Shang Jianyao quickly said the same words to the other 100 people to prevent them from destroying the effects of Thought Implantation.
He could only affect so many people at once, so he had to do it repeatedly. Furthermore, he had to be constantly careful not to arouse suspicion.
If it were in the real world, others would see a 180-degree turn in their colleagues and neighbors’ attitudes. In the beginning, they might think that Shang Jianyao’s playing of the emotion card had taken effect. But after two to three times, they would definitely sense something abnormal and attempt to shake the affected people to their senses, wasting all of Shang Jianyao’s previous efforts in Thought Implantation.
However, this was a psychological trauma. The room owner might not have had such an interaction with the people here, so she probably lacked the corresponding experience. Therefore, Shang Jianyao could ‘persuade’ a specific group over and over again under the watch of hundreds to thousands of people without suffering any backlash. It was as smooth as a speech.
Finally, Shang Jianyao completed the ‘Thought Implantation’ of all human consciousnesses in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area.
He saw everyone’s smiling faces again, felt the amiable attitude of most people, and received enthusiastic treatment.
Everything returned to before the change happened, but this psychological trauma didn’t collapse. The problem hadn’t been resolved at its core.
Shang Jianyao stroked his chin and muttered to himself silently, “Could it be that the room owner’s subconscious can determine that such understanding and acceptance are fake, and he is unwilling to believe it?”
Suddenly, his heart palpitated as he repeated, “Unwilling to believe it…
“In a psychological trauma, it’s like I’m acting as the room owner. I clearly know that the amiable enthusiasm in front of me is fake and that it’s brought about by Thought Implantation…
“I don’t believe it, so will the room owner not believe it?”
“So I’m the one who slipped through the cracks!” The honest Shang Jianyao clenched his right fist and punched his left palm.
In order not to let any Shang Jianyao slip through the cracks, they didn’t use the method of Shang Jianyao using Thought Implantation on Shang Jianyao. Instead, they returned to the beginning and used the military exoskeleton’s visor as a mirror to persuade themselves. “Look, being here is like returning to the company. Everyone smiles sincerely and speaks nicely. So…”
The Shang Jianyaos came to a realization. “Isn’t this home?”
He chatted with people everywhere and slowly organized groups of people to dance. One group sang, and another group dutifully played the role of the Rec Center’s PIC.
The joyous atmosphere gradually enveloped the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area.
…
Tarnan, Serene Dream Hotel.
The lady boss, Aynor, sat at the front desk. She propped her chin up with one hand and watched an Old World drama serial with a distracted expression.
Suddenly, she shivered.
She vaguely recalled some of the past buried deep in her heart and recalled the originally amiable, cold, and stiff faces.
She had actually gotten over it when she cleared the island of fear, but her heart still ached when the corresponding scenes occasionally flashed across her mind.
Unlike the past, the scene that flashed through her mind was: Everyone suddenly smiled at her and sang and danced enthusiastically!
“This is even more terrifying, alright…” Aynor muttered to herself.
She said this because she knew very well: the people in the residential area were already dead.
The dead wouldn’t change their expressions and smile. Due to this, Aynor suspected that someone had infiltrated her Mind Room and was exploring her corresponding traumas.
After a while, she shrank her body and muttered, “I’ll just keep watching dramas. He will leave after he’s done exploring.”
The price she paid was ‘avoiding reality.’
…
It was only when his mind was almost exhausted and he had no choice but to leave Room 506 that Shang Jianyao escaped the effects of Thought Implantation and found the corresponding judgment.
He stroked his chin and muttered to himself in confusion, “It didn’t work even when we believed it…
“What should we do?”
At this moment, in Room 12 of the 349th floor’s Zone C, Jiang Baimian was also thinking about Room 506’s psychological trauma.
As her thoughts wandered, questions suddenly flashed across her mind. The owner of Room 506 should be a resident of the Fourth Research Institute’s Residential Zone or someone who has lived there for a long time. He’s familiar with almost everyone and has a certain level of affection for them.
Then, why was he unanimously ostracized by the people in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area? Why was he treated coldly and with hatred?
What did he do? What trouble did he cause? Or what secret did he discover—one that he shouldn’t have discovered?

Jiang Baimian was rather curious about the encounter of Room 506’s owner. From her point of view, the other party’s relationship with the Fourth Research Institute was like the Old Task Force’s relationship with Pangu Biology. At present, she couldn’t imagine how they would leave Pangu Biology and be hated, vilified, and treated coldly by their families, relatives, neighbors, and fellow familiar employees.
Jiang Baimian couldn’t help but wonder if the owner of Room 506 had done something wrong back then, causing the Fourth Research Institute to be wiped out. Only then could the situation in the psychological trauma be explained.
Of course, this was only a guess based on the situation Shang Jianyao had come into contact with and the details he had learned. Once a clue pointed to another possibility, they had to throw away everything and start over.
This hypothesis also had certain problems. The two psychological traumas in Room 506 that Pangu Biology currently knew and the third place that Shang Jianyao had entered didn’t involve scenes like guilt, shame, or being guilty-conscience.
Jiang Baimian didn’t believe that a person who missed their hometown would accept the huge mistake they had made with a clear conscience while treating this as a painful memory.
Even if they instinctively deceived and hypnotized themselves, the truth would still reflect in their subconscious—unless they really didn’t think that it was a mistake. In hindsight, they still insisted that they had carried out the most correct choice. However, they couldn’t understand why their family, relatives, friends, and neighbors would view and treat them that way.
From this angle, Jiang Baimian had to believe that perhaps the problem was with the Fourth Research Institute. Coupled with the mutated corpses Shang Jianyao had seen in the first psychological trauma, she felt that this guess was reasonable.
Phew…
Jiang Baimian exhaled and retracted her thoughts. She planned on asking Shang Jianyao tomorrow if he had cleared Room 506’s psychological trauma and how he had cleared it.
At this moment, the radio in the corridor outside sounded.
“Good evening, everyone. I’m Newspoint broadcaster, Hou Yi. It’s 8 p.m. now…”
…
“Good evening, everyone. I’m Newspoint broadcaster, Hou Yi. It’s 8 p.m. now…”
Long Yuehong sat by Bai Chen’s bed and listened to the familiar, slightly childlike voice echo. He couldn’t help but laugh. “I heard that Hou Yi is actually one of the special cases in which genetic enhancement failed. She’s less than 1.6 meters tall, but she’s cheerful and born with a good voice. She never gave up on herself, and she ended up becoming the most popular broadcaster among the company’s employees in the past seven years.”
“She’s quite young then. She can’t be more than 30 years old.” Bai Chen nodded. “I thought she was a broadcaster you listened to growing up and that she’s already in her forties or fifties.”
“How can a person in their forties or fifties have such a voice?” Long Yuehong replied in amusement. He then retorted himself, “Not necessarily. Hou Yi is already in her late twenties, and her voice hasn’t changed much.”
“Some people are born with a childlike voice. It doesn’t change until they are over 60 years old.” Bai Chen had encountered such people in the past.
It was during her time in First City.
After chatting for a while, Long Yuehong stood up and said, “I have to go back.”
He had been promoted today and received a bonus. He couldn’t wait to share it with his family.
He was now a D8 employee. Once he had an internal transfer and left the Security Department, he could directly be promoted to D9.
This was the highest status an ordinary employee could pursue. As for management positions, they could only be chanced upon.
In addition, Long Yuehong chose to return today because he and Bai Chen had yet to register their marriage. It wasn’t good to stay over all the time.
“I’ll walk you out.” Bai Chen stood up as well.
Long Yuehong’s heart warmed, and he didn’t refuse.
After leaving the room and arriving at the corridor, Long Yuehong still held Bai Chen’s hand and slowly walked toward the elevator.
Bai Chen fell silent for a moment before asking, “What should I take note of when going to your house?”
Long Yuehong thought for a moment before saying, “There’s nothing to take note of. Just be normal and polite like Team Leader said.”
Frankly speaking, he didn’t have much experience and could only trust Jiang Baimian.
As for Jiang Baimian not having the corresponding experience either, Long Yuehong didn’t mind because Jiang Baimian told him and Bai Chen that she had always been invited to someone else’s house since she was young. She was the child who was praised by everyone and used as a model example for comparison.
Back then, the honest Shang Jianyao said in a hushed tone, “Maybe it’s not because you’re polite and know how to read people but because your father is in management.”
Jiang Baimian used actions to bring across the idea to Long Yuehong and Bai Chen what the consequences of being rude and not being observant would be.
“Okay.” Bai Chen recalled the core things her team leader had taught her—listen more, talk less; praise more, complain less; and smile more, move less.
Long Yuehong was just about to say something when he suddenly saw a person walking over.
The person had tanned skin, and his face was pockmarked. His eyes were bloodshot, and his looks were average. It was obvious that he hadn’t undergone genetic enhancement.
Long Yuehong knew this person—he was the foreign employee he had previously encountered in this floor’s public bathroom in the middle of the night.
The other party in the grayish-green camouflage uniform walked in a hurry and quickly brushed past them.
Bai Chen turned her head to glance at Long Yuehong. “You seem to know him?”
“When Hey played the prank, I went to the public bathroom and encountered him smoking inside,” Long Yuehong said truthfully.
Bai Chen tersely acknowledged it. “His name is Wang Xi. He just joined the company last year. I heard that he’s relatively short-tempered and often quarrels with others. If not for the company’s Order Supervisory Department, they might’ve fought.”
“Is that so? He has a pretty good temper.” Long Yuehong indicated that the other party had been rather polite during his short interaction with Wang Xi. Although he had been too rash back then, causing the situation to be relatively awkward, and Wang Xi had flown into a rage out of humiliation, he didn’t say anything nasty.
Bai Chen glanced at Long Yuehong’s mechanical arm and said, “It’s impossible for former wilderness nomads to always be irritable. Such people can’t live to this age.”
She paused and recalled something. “He seems to go to the public bathroom in the middle of the night often. Several neighbors encountered him.”
“That’s normal. He probably made it a habit,” Long Yuehong said casually.
At this moment, the two of them had already arrived at the elevator. He waved goodbye reluctantly and pressed the button representing the 495th floor.
Before returning home, Long Yuehong went to the Supplies Allocation Market and specially bought some fruits and snacks.
“Wow, there’s delicious food again!” Long Aihong ran over and took the bag from her brother the moment she saw him walk into the house.
Gu Hong grumbled with a smile, “Why are you buying these again? We just finished the previous batch!”
Long Yuehong took the opportunity to say, “The rewards for our mission have been distributed. I received 30,000 contribution points.”
“Another 30,000!” Although Long Aihong was already used to her brother receiving large bonuses every time he returned, she couldn’t hide her joy.
Long Dayong was gratified, but he sighed.
The smile on Gu Hong’s face widened as she suppressed her voice and asked, “Any promotions?”
Long Aihong immediately pricked up her ears.
“D8.” Long Yuehong was becoming more and more able to reveal his promotion frankly. He no longer needed Shang Jianyao’s help in publicizing his promotions.
“Ah, it’s really a blessing from the heavens.” Gu Hong clasped her hands and casually shook them.
Long Aihong said in anticipation, “Bro, you definitely won’t have a problem reaching D9. If you can enter management one day, I can be assigned a good job in the future! My classmates are so envious of me. Many of them want to be my sister-in-law!”
“What are you thinking about? You want to implicate your brother? It’s a taboo to interfere with job allocations!” Gu Hong reprimanded her daughter. “What I know is that they don’t do a thing during the job assignment, but they’ll find an excuse to transfer them after a year or two.”
“It’s still not confirmed,” Long Dayong muttered softly before saying to Long Yuehong, “Look at them. Sigh…”
Long Yuehong smiled and didn’t say a word.
As long as they were happy.
In any case, he had never thought of reaching management.
…
The next morning, Room 14 on the 647th floor.
Shang Jianyao recounted his encounter in the Fourth Research Institute’s Residential Zone with great detail about ‘heart-breaking’ and ‘gut-wrenching.’
He then said in confusion, “What’s the problem? Why was I unable to clear it despite making everyone treat me with their original attitude? Even I believed that it was real!”
Jiang Baimian, Long Yuehong, and Bai Chen fell silent as they searched for a possible reason.
One guess after another was raised before they were denied.
Jiang Baimian suddenly had an idea and recalled something Shang Jianyao had mentioned: “You previously said that when those people looked at you after the explosion, their expressions were cold. The muscles on their faces were stiff like emotionless corpses.”
“Yes.” Shang Jianyao nodded.
Jiang Baimian fell into thought. “Maybe those people did become corpses. After the accident in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area, those people might’ve died. What the room owner can’t shake off is their attitude toward him before they died; he also knows that this will never change. Therefore, this became a psychological trauma for him. No matter how you change those people’s attitudes, he subconsciously knows that it’s fake.”
“That’s possible.” Shang Jianyao stroked his chin. “Then, how did the room owner defeat the corresponding island and reconcile with himself?”
Jiang Baimian thought for a moment and said, “This might have to depend on why those people changed their attitude toward the room owner. Only by figuring this out can there be a basis for reconciliation.”
Jiang Baimian then talked about her guess last night: The room owner had made a mistake or discovered a secret that resulted in the Fourth Research Institute being wiped out. The people there had unanimously changed their attitude toward her.
Long Yuehong’s heart palpitated. “I really can’t imagine anyone betraying the place they were born and raised in.”
This was the same as how he couldn’t imagine leaving Pangu Biology. He felt that he might commit suicide if such a thing happened to him.
Shang Jianyao suddenly sang, “We lived like this for 30 years until the building collapsed1…”
Jiang Baimian rolled her eyes at him. She was just about to say something when the phone in the office rang.
Su Yu had received Shang Jianyao’s report and agreed to his request to meet him.

In the sofa area of Su Yu’s office on the fifth floor of the underground building.
Shang Jianyao met the board member again.
“Why do you suddenly have something to tell me?” Su Yu picked up the porcelain cup and gulped down two large mouthfuls.
Shang Jianyao—who was Zen Master Redemption—didn’t answer immediately and asked in concern, “Director Su, the report I submitted was alright, right?”
Su Yu took out a tissue and wiped the water from the corners of his mouth and the sweat on his forehead. “It was excellent, especially that cruise trauma. None of us have experienced something similar before. It’s too special; it actually manages to ‘save’ the exploration progress. Furthermore, time jumps upon each entry.
“The fact that you can find the key and clear such a trauma is enough to indicate that your observation, inference, and judgment are outstanding.”
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped—the honest him wasn’t modest at all. “I think so too.”
Su Yu was already accustomed to his behavior and smiled. “Such special psychological trauma involves the New World, and it has a certain value as a reference for the company’s powerhouses. We will reward you well. Is there anything you want?”
Shang Jianyao replied without hesitation, “Install a phone in my room!”
“…” Su Yu was stunned for a moment. “That’s it?”
“Yes.” Shang Jianyao nodded solemnly.
The Su Yu, who followed strict military doctrine, thought for a few seconds and said, “That’s not fair. Why don’t we get you a three-bedroom room that has a telephone installed?”
“There’s no need. We can’t decide on changing rooms ourselves,” Shang Jianyao explained in all seriousness. “I need to take my wife’s needs into consideration when I get married in the future. We have to consult her opinion.”
Su Yu asked in confusion, “You have a partner?”
“No,” Shang Jianyao replied smoothly.
Su Yu pressed, “When do you plan on having one?”
“After saving all of humanity!” Shang Jianyao’s tone was abnormally firm.
With a square face and a gray combat uniform, Su Yu could only understand this as a tactful rejection. He thought for a moment and said, “Make some other requests.”
Shang Jianyao thought for a moment. “Install a phone at Long Yuehong’s house, one for Bai Chen, and one for the room assigned to Long Yuehong and Bai Chen after they register their marriage.”
Su Yu laughed when he heard that. “You have something against phones, right? Alright, I’ll satisfy your request.”
He fell silent for a moment before asking, “Is the feedback you obtained from the special psychological trauma strong?”
The report Shang Jianyao submitted didn’t mention such content. Therefore, even if he hadn’t requested to meet Su Yu, the latter would have summoned him to inquire.
“You still want to talk about that?” Shang Jianyao had a look of surprise. “Isn’t it only about the exploration of those rooms? This is something that happened after the exploration ended.”
Su Yu maintained his smile. “You can choose not to answer.”
Shang Jianyao shook his head. “I can’t bring myself to do that.”
He paused and said before Su Yu could speak, “The feedback is about two to three times more than normal. There’s also the aura that threw the people on the cruise ship into chaos.”
He didn’t mention his additional gains or the Buddhist aura that had fused with the Six Senses Beads because it was unlikely that anyone would subsequently obtain it after clearing the corresponding psychological trauma.
Su Yu nodded slightly and said, “It’s about what I expected.”
Shang Jianyao drank a mouthful of cold water on the coffee table without standing on ceremony. “Director Su, do you have any research or relevant experience regarding these special psychological traumas?”
Su Yu leaned forward slightly and wiped the sweat from his forehead again. “What we can now determine is that special psychological traumas involve New World powerhouses and even a certain Kalendaria. The principle is that there’s probably an aura hidden in the target’s Sea of Origins or a projection of a New World node.”
After discussing this matter, Su Yu returned to the initial topic. “Why did you request to meet me?”
Shang Jianyao’s expression turned serious. “Director Su, do you still remember the Life Ritual parish?”
“Yes.” Su Yu nodded. “Why? Did you discover more clues regarding this parish again?”
Shang Jianyao replied seriously, “Yes. I suspect it’s them, but there’s no evidence.”
“Tell me about it.” Su Yu wasn’t careless.
Shang Jianyao—who had already prepared ten drafts—randomly chose one. “Here’s the thing. Through Long Yuehong, I found an employee who knows how to draw talismans and went to her to request a Babymaker talisman.”
Su Yu couldn’t help but ask, “I thought you don’t have a partner and don’t plan on finding a partner any time soon?”
Furthermore, it was clear that ‘any time soon’ would be indefinite. It was impossible to save all of humanity without centuries worth of work.
It was even more delusional to rely on three to four people.
Shang Jianyao nodded and replied, “I wanted to see if I could still have children after wearing the Babymaker talisman, even if I don’t have a partner.”
Upon recalling the other party’s mental state, Su Yu accepted this explanation.
“Then?” he asked.
“It doesn’t work.” Shang Jianyao had a look of regret.
Su Yu picked up the porcelain cup and drank a mouthful of water. “I’m asking how did you discover clues regarding the Life Ritual parish?”
Shang Jianyao came to a realization. “The employee who drew the talisman mentioned that her father—an old employee named Mu Renjie—suddenly suffered a myocardial infarction in the middle of the night five years ago while on the way to the public bathroom. He couldn’t be resuscitated. This old employee could draw real Babymaker talismans.”
“What do you mean ‘real Babymaker talismans?’” Su Yu always felt that Shang Jianyao was diverting his focus.
Shang Jianyao explained, “That employee didn’t know how to cherish what she had when she had it. She only realized how precious it was when she lost it. She no longer knows how to draw Babymaker talismans, so she can only make them up.”
“Is that so?” Su Yu thought for a moment and said, “There aren’t just one or two people who suddenly suffer from myocardial infarction. We’ve previously carried out a review. In theory, there shouldn’t be any problems with Mu Renjie’s death. But since there’s the Babymaker talisman, it can barely be considered a coincidence. I’ll get someone to investigate the employees on the corresponding route.”
He could easily do the math to know that the corresponding surveillance footage had definitely expired.
Shang Jianyao looked around and suppressed his voice. “Director Su, you have to be careful of moles. Didn’t the information leak out during the investigation of the Life Ritual parish, causing the key clues to be lost?”
He then pointed at the corridor outside. “The Doctor of the Church has always been watching us.”
Su Yu laughed involuntarily. “I won’t overlook this.”
Shang Jianyao clapped. He then inquired, “Director Su, does the company have a New World-level Arbiter of Fate domain powerhouse?”
This was the conclusion obtained from being able to sense the New World node through the Life Angel necklace after its change of aura—its usage hadn’t changed, but its effects were stronger.
Su Yu didn’t hide anything. “Yes.”
Shang Jianyao curiously asked, “Then, what does he think of the Life Ritual parish?”
“We never discussed such trivial problems with him.” Su Yu recalled and said, “But once, when he mentioned the various religions in the Ashlands, he vaguely said that different Kalendarium have different attitudes toward their believers. Some don’t care, some find it annoying, and some like it very much.”
Su Yu didn’t emphasize that the Kalendarium really existed because the Old Task Force had experienced Master Zhuang’s dream. They also suggested that the Old World’s destruction might be a result of the Eighth Research Institute’s forbidden experiments and that the source of the Heartless disease was most likely in the New World.
Shang Jianyao gave a terse acknowledgment. “Then, don’t disturb him with this matter.”
“Is there anything else?” Su Yu exhaled.
“No.” Shang Jianyao stood up and politely stretched out his right hand.
Su Yu stood up and lightly shook his hand.
“You still have a slight fever?” Shang Jianyao felt that the other party’s hand was relatively warm.
Su Yu didn’t answer and only nodded.
…
After returning to Room 14 on the 647th floor, Shang Jianyao roughly recounted his conversation with Director Su.
“Leave the rest to the company. We don’t have to worry.” Long Yuehong heaved a long sigh of relief.
Jiang Baimian smiled. “That’s right. What you need to worry about is the parent-meeting session and your marriage registration.”
It was still a day before Sunday.
“Yeah, yeah.” Long Yuehong suddenly felt a little nervous.
Upon seeing this, Bai Chen held his hand. “Will you give up if your parents aren’t satisfied with me?”
“No,” Long Yuehong replied firmly.
Bai Chen immediately smiled. “In that case, why are you nervous?”
Jiang Baimian felt a headache coming on as she watched. She quickly said to Shang Jianyao, “When you explore the psychological trauma in Room 506 tonight, focus on gathering information on the room owner and all kinds of other information. Only then can we guess what the room owner did and what mistakes he made back then to find a way to clear the psychological trauma.”
“Alright!” Shang Jianyao had always been interested in gossip.
…
In the Mind Corridor, in the psychological trauma in Room 506.
Shang Jianyao entered the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area again. He then casually found a lady who he found amiable and greeted her with a smile. “Good morning.”
When the lady in her thirties or forties revealed a confused expression, Shang Jianyao spoke first. “We’ve known each other for so long, and we’re all from the research institute. What do you think of me?”
He was using Thought Guidance, making the other party instinctively believe that he was a resident of the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area.
At this moment, everyone was present except for one person—Room 506’s owner.
At this rate, the lady in front of Shang Jianyao would most likely treat him as the other party.
The lady gradually smiled; then, she tip-toed and stroked Shang Jianyao’s hair. “Lass, why are you asking this question for no reason?”
The room owner is female… Shang Jianyao muttered to himself silently. He then smiled and replied, “It’s because I’m vexed.”
“Vexed over accepting which one? You’re too indecisive, but most young ladies are like that.” The lady smiled and consoled him. “When you Awaken later, you can use this as a price.”
Shang Jianyao smiled. “You also know about my Awakening?”
“Have you forgotten that I’m also an Awakened?” the lady asked in amusement.
Shang Jianyao’s heart palpitated. “Then, do you know much about Awakened?”
“What do you want to know?” the lady with a good bearing asked dotingly.
Shang Jianyao smiled and replied, “I want to know about the Arbiter of Fate’s domain.”
The lady in her thirties or forties thought for a moment before answering, “The Arbiter of Fate’s domain mainly affects the respiratory system and the heart. The known prices are limb paralysis, eyeball abnormalities, and…”
She paused and said, “There’s also chronic gastric problems and having a higher body temperature than normal people.”

“Chronic gastric problems…
“Higher body temperature than normal people…”
Shang Jianyao repeated the two prices.
Something was squirming under his skin and clothes, right beneath his forehead, shoulders, chest, and gut, but it ultimately didn’t burrow out.
The woman in her thirties or forties standing in front of him asked in concern, “What’s wrong? Could it be that you are considering choosing the Arbiter of Fate domain? Although the abilities in this domain are very strong, they often pay the price of health.”
Shang Jianyao smiled. “I suddenly thought of something. Talk to you later!”
He turned around and walked to the building that represented the room’s exit before returning to the Mind Corridor.
The ruthless Shang Jianyao stuck his head out from his left shoulder and said with a solemn expression, “Mei Shou’an always burps. Su Yu has been running a fever.”
Mei Shou’an was the person-in-charge of the C-14 project.
Su Yu was a board member of Pangu Biology. Shang Jianyao had just met him and reported Mu Renjie’s death to him, which was suspected to be related to the Life Ritual parish. He requested that he be wary of moles and send someone to investigate.
Burping often meant gastric problems. A fever was definitely a result of having a higher body temperature than an ordinary person.
The Shang Jianyaos didn’t argue and made the same choice.
He returned to the real world, opened his eyes, and got off the bed. He then walked to the door and gripped the door handle.
At this moment, he suddenly slowed down and stopped.
After freezing for a few seconds, Shang Jianyao retracted his hand, turned around, walked to the bed, and sat down.
We didn’t do anything. Making a report is every employee’s duty, he muttered to himself silently. As for revenge, it’s even more impossible to take it on the day of my report…
Shang Jianyao hummed a song and leisurely lay down, waiting for Hou Yi to broadcast Newspoint.
Then, he heard a knock on the door.
“Who is it?” Shang Jianyao suddenly sat up straight with an excited expression.
The person outside replied, “I’m here to install the phone. Don’t you know?”
“Oh right!” Shang Jianyao clenched his right fist and punched his left palm. He jumped off the bed, put on his shoes, and opened the door.
Outside the door was indeed an employee holding a toolbox and a telephone.
“You aren’t wearing a cap,” Shang Jianyao pointed out.
The male employee was confused. “Why must I wear a cap?”
He was about the same age as Shang Jianyao; it was obvious that he had only been working for a few years. The effects of genetic enhancement were better than Long Yuehong’s, and his skin was fairer because he had never been to the surface.
Shang Jianyao explained, “I’m referring to the kind of cap that can cover half of a face when pulled down.”
“Why should I wear that?” The male employee kept having the feeling that something was wrong with the other party’s brain and that they couldn’t communicate.
He didn’t live on this floor, nor did he have any relatives here, so he had never heard of Shang Jianyao.
Shang Jianyao sighed. “You’re not professional enough.”
He didn’t say anything else and pointed into the room. “Come in.”
Why is not wearing a cap being unprofessional? I’m just here to install a phone… The male employee rationally gave up on asking and walked into the room.
After looking around, he asked in surprise, “Are you sure it’s here?”
Who would install a phone in such a cramped room?
If one had enough contribution points, they would’ve long thought of a way to change to a bigger room. If one didn’t have enough contribution points, they wouldn’t even consider installing items that would rarely be used. A phone cost a sum of contribution points every month.
“That’s right, that’s right.” Shang Jianyao nodded in confirmation.
The male employee took out the list given by the higher-ups and confirmed the floor and door number again.
He was part of the Training Safeguard Department. This department’s role was to train new employees or transfer working people to new posts. It was also to provide logistical support for everyone.
After repeatedly confirming that there were no problems, the male employee began to busy himself.
Shang Jianyao retreated to the bed, sat down, and looked at the other party.
After the black telephone was installed, he still didn’t encounter any accidents.
He regretfully took the work order form from the other party and signed his name.
Although the male employee found it weird, he quietly left Shang Jianyao’s room since they weren’t familiar with each other and there was no need to chat. He then followed the address on the list to Room 11 on the same floor, Zone C.
Long Aihong skipped to the door and opened it, only to ask in confusion, “You are?”
“I’m here to install the phone. Don’t you know?” The male employee felt that it was his unlucky day.
“I don’t know.” Long Aihong shook her head in confusion.
The next second, her heart palpitated. She turned her body and head and shouted inside, “Bro! You got them to install a phone?”
Long Yuehong walked out of his room and glanced at his confused parents. He scratched his head with his left hand and said, “No…”
“Are you in the wrong place?” Long Aihong immediately turned around and asked the male employee confidently.
At this moment, Long Yuehong had an idea and recalled something: Shang Jianyao had once said that after submitting his experience regarding the exploration of new rooms, the reward he requested was to install a phone in his room.
Could it be… Long Yuehong walked to the door and probed the male employee, “Have you been to Zone B, Room 196?”
“Yes, yes, yes.” The male employee heaved a sigh of relief.
Long Yuehong confirmed his guess and asked, “How many phones are you going to install this time?”
“Three. The other one is for the 622nd floor,” the male employee replied truthfully. “But that one will be moved to another room later. The exact details haven’t been determined.”
Long Yuehong nodded. “I understand. Come in and do the installation.”
At this moment, Gu Hong came over and hesitantly said, “What’s the use of installing this phone? There’s nobody to call, and it costs dozens of contribution points every month.”
“Shang Jianyao got a ‘buy one, get two free.’ It doesn’t cost us any contribution points.” Long Yuehong smiled. “After I married Little White, I definitely had to move out. Don’t you want me to call back often?”
“Can’t you just come back?” Gu Hong nagged without stopping the installation.
She and Long Dayong couldn’t hide their smiles.
Telephones were a rarity, just like portable computers. It was enough to make the neighbors envious!
After installing the landline, Long Yuehong accompanied the male employee to the 622nd floor and explained the matter to Bai Chen. Finally, he used the number pasted on the phone and happily called home to test it out.
…
The next morning, Room 14 on the 647th floor.
As soon as Shang Jianyao entered, he grumbled at Long Yuehong and Bai Chen. “The two of you didn’t even call me after installing a phone!”
He looked abandoned.
“Huh?” Jiang Baimian looked at them in confusion.
Long Yuehong quickly recounted last night and said, “You have to pay additional contribution points to make a call.”
He was explaining why he didn’t call Shang Jianyao.
Shang Jianyao scoffed. “Don’t you know that the monthly fixed fee includes 120 minutes of free talk time?”
“That’s right.” Jiang Baimian testified.
“Is that so?” Long Yuehong was delighted; he planned on chatting on the phone with Bai Chen tonight!
Before he could calm down, Shang Jianyao turned to look at Jiang Baimian. “I learned something from Room 506’s trauma last night.”
“What is it?” Jiang Baimian asked seriously.
“It’s regarding the commonly seen price in the Arbiter of Fate domain.” Shang Jianyao’s expression turned serious.
Bai Chen pursed her lips. “What is it?”
Long Yuehong sensed that the atmosphere wasn’t right and unconsciously held his breath.
Jiang Baimian first confirmed that there were no wires or electrical appliances in the room before nodding. “Speak.”
Shang Jianyao said unhurriedly, “On top of what we know, there’s chronic gastric problems and a higher body temperature than normal people. I remember that Mei Shou’an always burps, while Director Su likes to perspire and likes to drink water in large mouthfuls. His hands are warmer than mine.”
An indescribable silence suddenly appeared in Room 14.
Everyone knew that Shang Jianyao meant that Su Yu and Mei Shou’an might be members of the Life Ritual parish. Although not all Awakened in the Arbiter of Fate domain believed in this Kalendaria, the possibility was definitely higher than that of other domains.
By reporting Mu Renjie’s death to Su Yu, it was akin to lodging a complaint at the person in question.
After a while, Long Yuehong slowly said, “Everyone knows that the company has Awakened in the Arbiter of Fate domain. It may be surprising that Director Su and Superintendent Mei are in this domain, but it’s reasonable. It’s not worth fussing over.”
“Back when the Life Ritual parish’s members were investigated, people like them should be the focus of attention, but the company didn’t discover any problems.” Bai Chen tried to eliminate the corresponding possibility from other angles.
“But why didn’t they put their price in the information?” The honest Shang Jianyao had a different opinion.
The Shang Jianyao that valued relationships explained, “Maybe it’s to effectively protect every Awakened’s secret. Those we often come into contact with won’t have their price listed on the information given to us.”
Jiang Baimian tersely acknowledged it. “In any case, we’ve reported the matter. Regardless of whether there are any problems with Director Su’s investigation, the subsequent matters have nothing to do with us. At most, Hey will mention it when he explores the Mind Corridor’s depths and is qualified to meet other directors.”
The meaning behind her words was that this matter ran deep. It was fine if there was no problem, but if there was really a problem, it was very easy to encounter something overwhelming if they continued investigating. Therefore, it was best to extract themselves first, observe the situation, and slowly plan.
Furthermore, the reason for their suspicion was relatively far-fetched. If not for the fact that Shang Jianyao held a grudge over the deaths caused by the Life Ritual parish, Jiang Baimian would’ve previously advised him to ignore Mu Renjie’s death.
“Alright.” Shang Jianyao was very serious this time.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen also felt that this was better. At the very least, they didn’t have to worry about revenge for the time being.
…
622nd floor, Zone B, Room 59.
Long Yuehong—who had planned on returning home to make a call to Bai Chen—decided to stay the night when he thought of the parent-meeting session tomorrow.
The two of them slept early, not wanting to look exhausted the next day.
In a daze, Long Yuehong had a dream.
In his dream, he realized that Mei Shou’an was indeed from the Life Ritual parish. However, he couldn’t immediately find Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao. He could only report to the management he had seen—the Security Department’s deputy minister and the Old Task Force’s immediate superior, Xenny.
After Xenny heard his recount, she stretched out her hands. As she smiled, she assumed a rocking posture as if carrying a baby.
This was the Life Ritual parish’s salute!
Long Yuehong woke up with a start. He panted heavily, glad that it was only a dream.
Bai Chen sat up and asked, “What’s wrong?”
Long Yuehong described his dream and smiled bitterly. “I had what I was thinking about in the day reflected in my dreams. I scared myself.”
Bai Chen’s expression changed slightly as she whispered, “I had the same dream.”

Long Yuehong’s body stiffened when he heard Bai Chen.
If only he had had such a dream, it could also be explained as him dreaming of it because of his thoughts in the day—the dream’s content was simply too realistic and terrifying. However, Bai Chen had the same dream. It couldn’t be described as a coincidence.
Even if they slept in the same bed and had similar experiences, it was impossible for the two of them to have dreams with similar details. There were no such coincidences in this world!
Almost at the same time, Long Yuehong and Bai Chen—who were relatively experienced—thought of a possibility, which was also the only possibility: They had their dreams affected by an Awakened in the corresponding domain!
Long Yuehong quickly looked out the window.
Through the curtain, he saw that the lights in the corridor hadn’t been switched off. From time to time, people would pass by outside.
Bai Chen deliberated for a few seconds and said, “Although the dream was sufficiently realistic, it didn’t mean to kill us.”
Real Dreamscape wasn’t something that could be woken up from via a shock. Most people would encounter death in their dreams and die in reality.
Long Yuehong had the same doubts and probed, “The person who affected our dream only wanted us to have that dream?”
If the other party had the intention of scaring them or testing their abilities, they wouldn’t have let the two people sleeping together have the same dream. This could easily be discovered and investigated by the company.
Therefore, Long Yuehong felt that the focus should be on the dream itself.
Bai Chen slowly nodded. “The person who affected our dream might be trying to tell us through that dream that Mei Shou’an is indeed from the Life Ritual parish. Minister Xenny is the same.”
Hiss!
Long Yuehong gasped. “No way…”
He still believed the possibility that Mei Shou’an was from the Life Ritual parish, but it would be without evidence to claim that Minister Xenny was one!
Long Yuehong then thought of something and frowned. “Why did we have the corresponding dream the night we suspected that Mei Shou’an might be from the Life Ritual parish? Could it be that someone can monitor our conversation in the office?”
This didn’t make sense!
Shang Jianyao could sense human consciousnesses in a large area, while his team leader could use electric signals to find any that fell through the cracks and eliminate certain devices. Room 14 could be said to be richly endowed with anti-interference equipment and was impregnable!
Bai Chen fell silent for a few seconds before saying, “If he learned of our suspicions by eavesdropping on our conversation, the Awakened probably wouldn’t have come to our dreams tonight. This will expose the fact that he can monitor our office. It’s still unknown who’s friend or foe.
“I think it’s either a coincidence or he has been trying to guide our dreams recently. However, his abilities are limited, so he couldn’t make something out of nothing. It was only when we began to suspect Mei Shou’an and Director Su that the dreams developed in the direction he hoped.”
Since the previous dreams didn’t meet the requirements, the other party would definitely give up midway. Long Yuehong and Bai Chen naturally couldn’t remember the corresponding content after waking up and couldn’t discover any abnormalities.
“If the latter is true, the Awakened doesn’t live far away,” Long Yuehong said solemnly.
This was the only way to influence this room’s dream every night without being suspected by the Order Supervisory Department or the employees on the same floor.
Due to an Awakened’s range and the fact that both of them were affected, Long Yuehong couldn’t rule out the people two to three floors above and below.
Bai Chen fell silent for a moment before saying, “That’s not the point. The point is whether the dream’s content is real.”
“This… Maybe the Awakened represents a certain faction that’s trying to sow discord.” Long Yuehong didn’t dare to make an affirmative judgment.
Bai Chen exhaled silently. “Sometimes, I feel that it’s safer outside than in the company. At least we know who the enemy is and where the danger comes from. When we encounter a problem, we can fight it head-on. When it’s time to evacuate, we can evacuate immediately. We won’t be overly suspicious and be restrained.”
With the Old Task Force’s current abilities and equipment, nobody could capture them once they chose to escape apart from a few situations.
“It’s still alright… There are ultimately only a few problems.” Long Yuehong still had a lot of affection for Pangu Biology and the underground building. Even though he often fantasized of a time when the company moved to the ground, allowing everyone to see the blue sky and feel the natural wind, he had never considered completely severing ties with the underground building.
This place represented his childhood, teenage years, and half of his youth. It was the most carefree period.
Bai Chen didn’t retort and looked at the phone in the room. “Let’s tell Team Leader and Hey as soon as possible.”
It wasn’t lights-out yet. The light from outside could be faintly seen through the curtain.
“Will this be monitored?” Long Yuehong was a little worried.
Bai Chen calmly replied, “It might be a good thing to be monitored.”
“Ah…” Long Yuehong was confused at first before he came to a realization.
Bai Chen meant: Those who could monitor phones were most likely from the Life Ritual parish, just like how the Doctor of the Church controlled the surveillance cameras back then. After the Life Ritual parish discovered that other organizations were secretly targeting them, their focus wouldn’t be on the Old Task Force!
Go ahead and fight amongst yourselves. Don’t disturb us!
“Alright, who should we call first?” Long Yuehong’s first reaction was to get Jiang Baimian.
Although Jiang Baimian was much weaker than Shang Jianyao in terms of Awakened abilities, she was more reliable in other aspects, especially in terms of intelligence.
“Let’s give Hey a call first. He’s alone, and he lives on the floor of an ordinary employee. It’s relatively more dangerous.” Bai Chen gave her opinion from a different perspective.
Long Yuehong readily agreed. He got off the bed, walked to the table, picked up the phone, and dialed Shang Jianyao’s number.
…
Mind Corridor, Room 506.
Shang Jianyao chatted with many people in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area by passing off as the room owner.
In addition to obtaining a lot of relatively useful information, including but not limited to the price of certain domains and the Fourth Research Institute’s suspicion of the Eighth Research Institute’s forbidden experiments, Shang Jianyao also roughly restored the room owner’s original image.
A young girl who was rather pretty in the residential area; she had several suitors and was filled with interest in the Old World’s entertainment. She liked to replicate the clothes in them and dress up in them. Even though she was often scared to sleep because of horror scenes and had tears in her eyes from the emotional scenes, she still enjoyed it.
She had a cheerful personality and appeared to be a forthright person. In fact, she was indecisive when she encountered major matters and couldn’t make up her mind.
She was very interested in all kinds of things in the Ashlands. From time to time, she would travel elsewhere with the Fourth Research Institute’s trading teams. She was a rather curious person.
Perhaps it was because she grew up in a relatively stable place like the Fourth Research Institute’s residential zone, but she had a simple sense of justice and views of good and evil like Long Yuehong prior to his joining the Old Task Force…
Just as Shang Jianyao was about to inquire further, he heard a ringing sound.
The people around didn’t sense anything.
Someone’s calling me? Shang Jianyao became excited.
He ran to the exit.
After returning to the real world, he picked up the phone and asked in all seriousness, “Hello, who is it?”
“Me,” Long Yuehong replied.
“Who’s me?” Shang Jianyao began to pester him endlessly.
Long Yuehong’s forehead twitched. “I’m Long Yuehong. Little White and I just had the same dream.”
“You guys slept so early?” Shang Jianyao’s focus was completely wrong.
Long Yuehong took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. “That’s not important. The important thing is that we had the same dream. We all dreamed that Director Mei Shou’an is from the Life Ritual parish. When we reported it to Minister Xenny, she also saluted with the Life Ritual’s etiquette.”
Shang Jianyao let out a long exclamation. “There are so many fellow parishioners…
“You guys woke up too early. You have to see what information the person who affected your dream can provide. Perhaps you will later discover that we are also from the Life Ritual parish…”
He let his imagination run wild for a moment before asking, “Did you tell Big White?”
“Not yet. Calling her now.” Long Yuehong was very glad that he had called Shang Jianyao’s house first. Otherwise, there would be no end to it.
After he hung up, Bai Chen called Jiang Baimian.
…
Ring! Ring!
Xue Sumei picked up the call. “Who are you looking for?”
“Hello, I’m looking for Jiang Baimian. I’m her colleague,” Bai Chen replied.
Xue Sumei cupped the receiver with her hand and shouted into the study, “Mianmian, it’s for you!”
After Jiang Baimian picked up the call in the study, Xue Sumei put down the receiver on the telephone outside and said to Jiang Wenfeng in disappointment, “It’s a woman.”
“You can’t rush such things.” Xue Wenfeng smiled and shook his head.
At this moment, Jiang Baimian figured out Bai Chen and Long Yuehong’s encounter after exchanging a few words. She thought for a moment and said, “From the looks of it, we have found ourselves in muddy waters. Could it be that the company has already been seriously corrupted and that many foreign organizations have expanded? It only appears calm on the surface because of Big Boss and a few powerhouses in higher management? Are other organizations taking the opportunity to eliminate the Life Ritual parish this time?”
“Then, it’s best if we just sit and watch.” Bai Chen voiced her thoughts.
Jiang Baimian tersely acknowledged it. “I think so too.”
After all, they couldn’t find a higher-up they could completely trust unless they could report it to Big Boss directly.
Jiang Baimian smiled and said, “It won’t be too late to discuss this tomorrow. Take turns sleeping tonight to see if you have any more similar dreams. After two to three attempts and confirming that there are no problems, continue sleeping together. Don’t delay the parent-meeting session tomorrow.”
After comforting Bai Chen and Long Yuehong, Jiang Baimian hung up. She then sat there and fell into deep thought.
After dozens of seconds, she picked up the receiver and dialed Shang Jianyao’s number.
“Hello.” Shang Jianyao’s voice quickly sounded. “Who is it?”
“Who do you think it is?” Jiang Baimian asked in amusement.
“It might be Little Red or Little White.” Shang Jianyao said confidently, “Do you want to discuss how they had the same dream tonight?”
Jiang Baimian smiled. “There’s no rush for that; let’s wait and see. Did you figure out the personality and experience of Room 506’s owner tonight?”
“Yes!” Shang Jianyao explained everything he had learned in detail.
Jiang Baimian fell silent for a moment before frowning. “Highly curious… With a sense of justice and a simple sense of good and evil… Do you think the owner of Room 506 back then also fell into our current dilemma? In the end, a wrong choice caused the place she wanted to protect to fall into a disaster?”
She couldn’t help but make connections because the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area was very similar to the environment, atmosphere, and feeling inside Pangu Biology.

Upon hearing Jiang Baimian’s question, Shang Jianyao slapped his thigh. “What a pity!”
“What’s a pity?” Jiang Baimian couldn’t keep up with his train of thought.
Shang Jianyao replied in frustration, “Didn’t I break into the other party’s dream when I first entered Room 506? In hindsight, I shouldn’t have faced the danger with courage to end things quickly. Instead, I should’ve tried ‘Guidance,’ making Room 506’s owner reveal what had happened in her dream. In the end, sigh…”
He couldn’t enter the other party’s dream again for the time being, at least not before clearing the third psychological trauma.
This was a rule in the exploration of the rooms in the Mind Corridor. The information provided by Pangu Biology to Shang Jianyao had a clear description: When entering a room for the first time, one might face a psychological trauma or intrude into another person’s dream. But once one enters a psychological trauma, it will be fixed. One will face the same scene every time until they clear it.
A psychological trauma will connect to another psychological trauma. Unless an explorer can reach the place closest to the target’s Sea of Origins and clear the room, it is impossible for them to encounter a dream again.
As for whether the rooms representing the Kalendarium were like this, it was impossible to determine because there were too few samples.
Jiang Baimian knew what Shang Jianyao meant and sighed.
“That’s right. If we can use the dream to figure out the encounter of Room 506’s owner, it will indeed be a good thing for us. Even if this has nothing to do with the turbulent undercurrents in the company, it has a certain value as a reference.”
Shang Jianyao looked at the phone on the table and asked excitedly, “Is there a way to use the psychological trauma to communicate with the room owner?”
Jiang Baimian held the receiver and thought for a moment. “That’s unlikely. What you are exploring now is the third psychological trauma. Although it will make the room owner have nightmares continuously and become vigilant, the information doesn’t mention if such nightmares are directly related to your actions or if the corresponding details can be fully reflected. Besides, even if you can really transmit information through nightmares, the room owner can’t give you feedback…”
At this point, Jiang Baimian suddenly stopped.
Her memory had always been good. A sentence from the information Shang Jianyao had relayed surfaced in her mind: “If you have nightmares for days and feel exhausted every time you wake up, it means that someone has entered your Mind Room and has explored it to a rather deep extent. You have to think of a way to lock onto the other party and give them a warning. If they refuse, prepare for battle…”
Being able to lock onto, warn, and fight means that we can communicate and receive feedback in a sense… Jiang Baimian muttered to herself and said, “You can indeed give it a try, although I’m not that confident.”
What she didn’t have confidence in was whether the nightmare could fully depict Shang Jianyao’s actions in the psychological trauma, whether it would be exaggerated, whether it would only reflect a symbolic meaning, or whether it would only reflect a certain scene.
Of course, even if the message was wrong, it was also very good to make Room 506’s owner sense the danger and give them a warning. This meant that there was a possibility of communication.
“Alright!” Shang Jianyao couldn’t hide his eagerness.
After hanging up, he immediately lay on the bed and entered the Mind Corridor again.
In the Fourth Research Institute’s residential zone, Shang Jianyao spent a lot of effort to complete the Thought Implantation for everyone.
Therefore, some of these people were shouting, “I have something to consult you about.” Some were in charge of belting the chorus ‘come on, come on.’ Some were arranged in teams and posed with SOS symbols. Some repeated the word ‘friend’ over and over again. There were all kinds of variations.
Tarnan, Serene Dream Hotel.
Aynor—who had already gone to bed—suddenly shivered and woke up with a start.
In her dream, she was surrounded by darkness as her dense, blood-red eyes opened one after another. Ancient god-like whispers constantly echoed in her ears, but she couldn’t discern them clearly.
After Aynor snapped to her senses, she gritted her teeth and muttered, “That fellow is still exploring my psychological trauma!”
She still had a certain level of experience with such situations. In the early years, many people had explored the depths of her Mind Room, making her have nightmares continuously. This made her feel exhausted when she woke up every day.
Her choice back then was to be a coward and avoid reality.
Although this was shameful, it worked. After those people finished exploring the room, they didn’t choose to invade her Sea of Origins and left readily.
Later, such matters became fewer and fewer as if nobody tried to explore the depths of her Mind Room. It had been a long time since Aynor had nightmares.
Due to this experience, her response was self-evident.
Aynor hatefully said, “If you dare—if you dare to invade my Sea of Origins, I-I’ll fight you!”
She pulled the blanket over her and covered her body and head tightly as if she were an ostrich burying its head in sand.
Room 506, in the psychological trauma at the Fourth Research Institute’s residential zone.
Shang Jianyao waited bitterly for a long time, but he didn’t receive any warning.
“Could it be that this isn’t considered the depths of the room?” the calm and rational him muttered to himself in confusion.
Considering that they had expended a lot of mental energy and that something could go wrong if they stayed any longer, the Shang Jianyaos left.
…
Ding ring ring!
At 1 a.m., Long Yuehong and Bai Chen were woken up by the phone. Due to their experience, this sudden development made their hearts race.
The two of them glanced at each other in confusion and vigilance.
“Could it be a death call?” Long Yuehong recalled the Old World entertainment he had watched.
In the current Ashlands, this was possible.
Awakened had all kinds of strange abilities. Some could exert influence through electromagnetic waves.
“It can’t be that fast, right…” Bai Chen sat up and walked to the desk.
Nights in Pangu Biology were always cold. Long Yuehong saw that Bai Chen’s clothes were thin and that she was trembling a little. He quickly took her cotton coat, stood up, walked over, and helped drape it over her.
As for himself, he had already brought a new thick, military-green cotton coat to Bai Chen’s. He wasn’t as unprepared as last time.
Earning more contribution points made life comfortable!
Long Yuehong looked at the ringing phone and took a deep breath. “You have to add a caller ID later.”
“Anyone who can transmit power through a phone can definitely tamper with the displayed number.” Bai Chen sensed that her neighbors were showing signs of waking up and stretched her hand toward the telephone.
She disconnected the line.
The room became extremely quiet.
Long Yuehong calmed down and voiced his thoughts. “We have to tell Team Leader and Hey immediately to prevent them from encountering this.”
Bai Chen agreed.
They connected the line again, and Long Yuehong dialed Shang Jianyao’s number.
The latter lived alone, so they didn’t have to worry about disturbing his family.
“Hey?” Just as Long Yuehong said that, Shang Jianyao grumbled, “Why didn’t you answer my call?”
Ah? Long Yuehong looked at Bai Chen in surprise.
The call just now was actually from Shang Jianyao!
“What’s the matter?” Long Yuehong quickly asked.
Shang Jianyao sighed. “I’m just concerned about you. I wanted to ask if you had the same dream after returning to the 622nd floor.”
“…” Long Yuehong’s facial muscles immediately warped. “You can ask tomorrow morning.”
Shang Jianyao added, “If you fall into Real Dreamscape at the same time and can’t wake up, you might die at any moment. Such a call is enough to save your lives.”
That’s true… Long Yuehong scratched his head with his empty iron-black right hand.
Bai Chen’s expression relaxed.
Although they had already followed Jiang Baimian’s instructions and took turns watching each other as one slept for an hour until they confirmed that there were no problems before hitting the sack together, everyone was worried that an accident would happen.
“You have to thank me,” Shang Jianyao reminded him.
Long Yuehong took a deep breath. “Thank you.”
He forcefully steered the topic back on track. “We didn’t have the same dream again, nor did we fall into Real Dreamscape. We slept very normally.”
“That’s good,” Shang Jianyao said in all seriousness. He then laughed. “Do you need me to call you to use the bathroom at three?”
“There’s no need!” Long Yuehong replied firmly.
If he went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, he was afraid of following in the footsteps of Mu Renjie!
After the call, Bai Chen and Long Yuehong returned to bed.
The two of them took more than 20 minutes to fall asleep again. They also kept worrying that Shang Jianyao would call again at some point in time.
Long Yuehong wanted to disconnect the phone, but he was afraid of missing key matters.
The two of them slept uneasily until 7:30 in the morning.
Although they usually woke up a little earlier than usual for breakfast during workdays, it was Sunday. They had suffered a shock last night and couldn’t sleep well.
They originally planned on waking up at 9 a.m. and having snacks for a simple meal.. In the end, Shang Jianyao called again and reminded them: It was the day of the parent-meeting session, so they had to make preparations.

“It’s only 7:30!” Long Yuehong slammed the phone and gritted his teeth.
He wished he could rush back to the 495th floor now and beat Shang Jianyao up. Unfortunately, he wasn’t the latter’s match.
“We’re just in time to have breakfast at the canteen.” Bai Chen had been forced to wake up early countless times. Of course, her previous instances of being forced to wake up early were based on having to move in the middle of the night despite scheduling to wake up at dawn.
“Are you not going to sleep for a while longer?” Long Yuehong asked in concern.
There was still an hour and a half before 9 a.m. They could still get some sleep.
Bai Chen shook her head. “No, I’m completely awake.”
Long Yuehong couldn’t help but look back at the phone on the table. “I can finally understand the complicated feelings the protagonists in the Old World’s entertainment have toward phones.”
He pressed his cold right palm to his face and forced himself to calm down.
After breakfast, Long Yuehong and Bai Chen killed some time before heading out at 9:30. They carried the cloth, biscuits, and fruits they had bought in advance and took the elevator to the 495th floor.
It was Sunday, and many employees were active on the streets and in the Rec Center. A large number of them knew Long Yuehong. Upon seeing him hold Bai Chen’s hand, they smiled meaningfully and greeted him enthusiastically.
Long Yuehong straightened his back and tried his best not to appear constrained and uneasy. He openly greeted his neighbors and led Bai Chen all the way to Zone C, Room 11.
Gu Hong already had the door open and sent Long Aihong and Long Zhigu to loiter around the corridor outside. They were to keep note of the guest’s arrival.
“She’s here! She’s here!” Long Aihong shouted into the room and quickly walked toward Long Yuehong and Bai Chen. She smiled sweetly and said, “Hello, Sister-in-law!”
On the one hand, she was happy for her brother and was ecstatic to have a guest. On the other hand, she had heard her brother mention that her future sister-in-law had a high rank and had saved up a lot of contribution points. If she could build a good relationship with her, wouldn’t she have another source of snacks in the future?
“Hello.” Bai Chen recalled Jiang Baimian’s teachings and prevented the smile on her face from being too stiff.
At this moment, Gu Hong had already walked out of the room and enthusiastically greeted, “Come on in. Why are you chatting at the door?”
We haven’t had the time to chat, alright? Hypocritical woman. Long Aihong criticized her mother inwardly.
Bai Chen had previously mentally rehearsed the process of meeting the parents. She immediately nodded and greeted, “Hello, Auntie.”
She couldn’t change the way she addressed her before the marriage registration.
Gu Hong swept her gaze across Bai Chen’s face and was rather satisfied. However, she felt a little regretful when she saw Bai Chen’s height.
The smile on her face remained the same. “Come in. Come in.”
Long Yuehong quickly held Bai Chen’s hand and walked into the room with the gifts they had bought, handing the items to his mother. “Mom, this is from Little White.”
“Gosh, you’re too polite. There’s no need to buy these!” Gu Hong smiled as she handed the gifts to Long Dayong.
Bai Chen suddenly found it surreal: This was identical to the scene her team leader had used as an example.
The subsequent development was about what Bai Chen had expected—everyone sat down and smiled as they chatted about how she and Long Yuehong knew each other and whether they had suffered a lot in the Ashlands.
Bai Chen replied frankly since it wasn’t anything sensitive.
They chatted until it was almost lunch when Gu Hong finally stood up and smiled. “Let’s chat as we eat. We can’t go hungry.”
“Alright, Auntie.” Bai Chen heaved a sigh of relief.
Jiang Baimian had said that if the elders were relatively satisfied during the first parent-meeting session, they wouldn’t test her by asking questions that could easily cause conflict. They would only talk about trivial matters.
Therefore, Bai Chen preliminarily believed that her performance just now barely passed. Long Yuehong’s parents and siblings had a good impression of her.
Listen more, talk less; praise more, complain less; and smile more, move less. That was all.
While Gu Hong helped Long Dayong serve the dishes and Long Yuehong went to help because he was embarrassed to sit idle, Long Aihong finally found an opportunity to approach Bai Chen and ask with a suppressed voice, “Sister-in-law, why do you like my brother?”
“He’s pretty nice. Why can’t I like him?” Bai Chen said truthfully.
Long Aihong smiled and asked, “I mean, how did you guys develop feelings for each other?”
Bai Chen recalled and said, “We are together every day, often going through… Uh, often having to face danger together. He also appears very brave and shows his value in you. It’s very normal for us to develop feelings for each other.”
“I see… How romantic!” Long Aihong recalled scenes from Old World entertainment and sighed emotively with a yearning look.
Bai Chen didn’t give the young lady a blow. She didn’t even dare to say the words ‘go through life and die together,’ afraid that it would agitate Long Yuehong’s family.
She only smiled and reminded her, “It’s unlikely that you will be assigned to the Security Department.”
“That’s right…” Long Aihong let out a long sigh. She then looked at Bai Chen and said with sparkling eyes, “Sister-in-law, tell me about your adventures. My brother rarely mentions them.”
“If there’s a chance later.” Bai Chen didn’t refuse.
Long Aihong immediately beamed. “Alright, alright. Sister-in-law, you’re the best!”
After receiving such treatment, Bai Chen suddenly felt like she was starting to blend into the family.
Outside Room 14, at the end of the corresponding corridor, a figure in blue clothes secretly watched Long Yuehong’s house.
It was none other than Shang Jianyao.
“What are you doing?” Someone suddenly patted his shoulder from behind.
Shang Jianyao turned around and saw Jiang Baimian’s familiar face.
“I thought it was the Order Supervisors.” He clearly heaved a sigh of relief.
“Why are you sneaking around?” Jiang Baimian sized up the fellow in confusion.
Shang Jianyao quickly explained, “I’m just afraid that Little White will have stage fright and can’t perform well. If anything really happens, I’ll rush over and guide Little Red’s parents and siblings to ignore the unpleasant scene and do it over.”
Jiang Baimian said in exasperation and amusement, “You really value your friends.”
“It wasn’t easy for Little Red and Little White these past few years.” Shang Jianyao suddenly spoke sincerely. He then asked Jiang Baimian, “Why are you here?”
Today was only Bai Chen’s meeting of the parents, not a wedding banquet.
Jiang Baimian laughed. “You can care about Little Red and Little White, but can’t I? I came over to see how effective it was and if there’s a need for me to smooth things over.”
“You’re late. It’s already over,” Shang Jianyao pointed out.
Jiang Baimian gritted her teeth. “Life is always filled with all kinds of accidents.”
“Therefore, you find yourself lost as you walk…” The honest Shang Jianyao was quickly pressed to the ‘ground’ by the other Shang Jianyaos.
Jiang Baimian slowly exhaled and looked past Shang Jianyao at Long Yuehong’s house. She revealed a gratified expression when she heard the faint peals of laughter.
Jiang Baimian retracted her gaze and said to Shang Jianyao, “Let’s go take a look at your room.”
“What do you want?” Shang Jianyao was horrified.
Jiang Baimian rolled her eyes at him. “Let’s talk about what happened recently.”
Shang Jianyao came to a realization and looked around warily. “I’ll go back first. Come over later. Remember—Zone B, Room 196.”
You make it seem like a spy meeting… Jiang Baimian didn’t interrupt Shang Jianyao’s fun and watched him walk to Zone B.
In any case, what they wanted to talk about was indeed rather confidential.
After waiting for a few minutes, Jiang Baimian strode forward and calmly headed to Zone B.
Before long, she entered Room 196, where Shang Jianyao lived. She sized up this place that was only six square meters.
She didn’t comment. She pulled a chair behind the desk by the window, sat down, and asked, “What are your plans regarding the Life Ritual parish?”
The reason Jiang Baimian found an opportunity to talk to Shang Jianyao about this was that she was worried he would ultimately be unable to calm down and make an irrational attempt.
Shang Jianyao’s eyes lit up. “I plan on asking for your help.”
“Help with what?” Jiang Baimian raised her guard.
Shang Jianyao—who was sitting by the bed—said with bright eyes, “If we don’t take action, will the person who affected Little White and Little Red’s dreams be unable to hold back and make them have the same dream again to transmit more important information?”
“It’s quite likely,” Jiang Baimian evaluated calmly.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “We all know that it’s impossible to determine who’s who through human consciousness. If the people affected in the dream weren’t Little White and Little Red but you and me, could we have sensed the target in reverse, captured him, and interrogated him about his goal and the authenticity of the information regarding the Life Ritual parish?”
“In theory, yes.” Jiang Baimian roughly understood Shang Jianyao’s plan.
Shang Jianyao excitedly said, “Let’s find an opportunity to disguise ourselves as Little White and Little Red and live in Little White’s house, waiting to be affected by the dream. We can do this during working hours. It won’t be easy to be discovered.”
“But it’s impossible to disguise ourselves every day. We have no way of knowing when the other party will come to affect our dreams.” Jiang Baimian doused his enthusiasm.
Shang Jianyao thought about it and felt a little depressed.
Jiang Baimian scoffed. “A plan can’t rely on coincidence or luck. The success rate of your plan isn’t better than directly asking Mei Shou’an and Minister Xenny if they are members of the Life Ritual parish…”
As she spoke, Jiang Baimian suddenly fell silent.
Shang Jianyao seemed to have received a reminder as he clenched his right fist and punched his left palm. “That’s right. We can ask directly!”
His expression gradually turned ruthless. “It’s too risky and sudden to find Director Su, but we have sufficient and reasonable reasons to find Mei Shou’an and Minister Xenny. Use the excuses of going to Mei Shou’an to fulfill the previous promise of undergoing a body examination and the reporting of Little White and Little Red’s dream to Minister Xenny. When the time comes, conceal the ‘persuasion’ in our conversation and obtain the most realistic answer.”
“What if there’s nothing wrong with them? It’s impossible for you to maintain the effects of Thought Implantation all the time,” Jiang Baimian asked in a deep voice.
Shang Jianyao smiled frankly. “If there’s really nothing wrong with them and that we are the ones overthinking and being used, I will remove my Thought Implantation and accept the corresponding punishment.. Even if I lose everything and get locked up to undergo education, I have no complaints.”

Jiang Baimian looked at Shang Jianyao and said with a serious expression, “It’s not a trivial matter to use your abilities on your superior. No organization can tolerate such a thing.”
Shang Jianyao replied indifferently, “After entering the Mind Corridor, the company once said that I could be promoted straight to M1, but I rejected it. According to this standard, Minister Xenny and I are considered of the same rank.”
He paused and smiled again. “Besides, everyone who should know knows that I have a serious mental illness.”
This reason is really versatile… Jiang Baimian was speechless.
“For a person like me, it’s reasonable even if I make any mistakes. It has nothing to do with you,” Shang Jianyao said smugly. “Before bringing me to meet Minister Xenny, you couldn’t foresee that I would have an episode. Besides, for a valuable mental patient like me, imprisoning and killing me isn’t the best way to extract value. If I were Big Boss or a member of the Board of Directors, I definitely would choose to throw such a person into the Ashlands and send him out on one mission after another to reduce his stay in the company and let him harm other factions.”
Jiang Baimian felt like applauding him that very moment. She even automatically added some details to Shang Jianyao: They wouldn’t completely forbid him from returning to the company. Every once in a while, they would need him back to visit ‘loved ones’ to maintain an emotional connection.
Upon seeing Jiang Baimian remain silent, Shang Jianyao continued bewitching her. “We were born and raised in the company; this is our home. We have to treat anything that might threaten our home seriously and not have any wishful thinking. We would rather make mistakes than let it go.”
This sentence was like an arrow that stabbed at Jiang Baimian’s soft spot.
It might be difficult for people from other factions to understand the feelings native employees had for Pangu Biology, but as people sharing the same experiences, Shang Jianyao knew very well. In such a sealed and relatively stable environment, it gave people a sense of belonging. Furthermore, Jiang Baimian, Shang Jianyao, and the others’ parents were born and raised locally.
After a few seconds, Jiang Baimian teased, “Did you use your abilities on me? Otherwise, why would I accept such a risky, bold, crazy, and seriously illegal plan?”
“Yes.” Shang Jianyao nodded.
“Huh?” Jiang Baimian was a little stunned.
She was very sure that Shang Jianyao wouldn’t use his abilities on her on such a very important matter. Furthermore, before Shang Jianyao gave such a reason, her heart had already wavered. The reason was that she attached great importance to the company.
On second thought, Jiang Baimian understood why Shang Jianyao nodded.
He wants me not to have to shoulder any responsibility and blame my cooperation on Thought Guidance… At this thought, Jiang Baimian’s heart warmed as she smiled. “Then, I’ll take it as a yes.”
Shang Jianyao laughed as well; he was very happy.
…
On Monday morning, Long Yuehong and Bai Chen—who had met the former’s parents—applied for leave to register their marriage at the Order Supervisory Bureau on the 495th floor. Only Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao were left in the Old Task Force’s office.
This was a good opportunity. Jiang Baimian picked up the receiver and called Minister Xenny’s office.
After the call connected, she said seriously, “Minister, I’m Jiang Baimian. I have something to report to you.”
She then tersely made a few words of affirmation and answered the other party’s question. “It’s relatively urgent and important.
“Alright, I’ll be right there.”
After Jiang Baimian hung up, Shang Jianyao curiously asked, “Why didn’t you mention that I was also going?”
Jiang Baimian slowly exhaled and simply explained, “If Minister Xenny is indeed problematic and knows that you will follow in advance, she will definitely think of a way to guard against abilities like Thought Guidance. When the time comes, it’s difficult to say if the results of our probing will be authentic.”
Jiang Baimian’s smile had a hint of self-deprecation. After all, she was using her tricks on Pangu Biology and her immediate superior.
Clap! Clap! Clap!
Shang Jianyao clapped for Big White’s meticulousness.
The two of them then looked at each other before walking out of Room 14 and heading to the elevator area that led to the 646th floor.
With Shang Jianyao around, Jiang Baimian didn’t get lost and successfully arrived at Xenny’s deputy minister’s office.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
Under the gazes of two armed guards, she bent her finger and knocked on the door.
“Come on in.” Xenny’s voice sounded.
Jiang Baimian turned the doorknob and pushed open the door. She saw Minister Xenny sitting behind a large desk in a smart, white shirt and short black top.
“Him?” Xenny—who had long chestnut hair and chestnut eyes—saw Shang Jianyao and cast a confused gaze at Jiang Baimian.
Jiang Baimian smiled and said, “He was the one who discovered that matter. I was afraid I’d miss out on some important details, so I brought him along.”
After explaining, Jiang Baimian began to wait for Minister Xenny’s reaction.
If the latter was very resistant to communicating with Shang Jianyao now, her suspicion would rise exponentially.
Xenny slowly nodded and pointed at the sofa. “Let’s chat there.”
She then stood up and walked over with her sky-blue porcelain teacup.
Jiang Baimian led Shang Jianyao in and closed the door.
The two of them sat on the long sofa opposite Xenny, and Jiang Baimian first started the conversation. “Minister, Shang Jianyao actually mentioned that matter when he met Director Su. However, we later made a new discovery and felt that it was necessary to report it to you.”
Xenny didn’t hide her enlightenment. “Are you talking about Mu Renjie? Director Su has spoken to me. I’m in charge of selecting reliable people for the corresponding investigations. Why? Do you want to be part of it?”
“That’s right, that’s right!” Shang Jianyao had an expression that said: “I’m here to recommend myself.” He was very sincere with genuine interest.
This was within Jiang Baimian’s expectations because it was impossible for Su Yu to investigate personally. He would definitely find a trustworthy subordinate and assign the mission. The probability of him handing it to Xenny was considerably high.
Jiang Baimian didn’t expect Shang Jianyao to act so naturally and sincerely.
This might be the benefit of having a split personality… She could only sigh.
Xenny smiled and replied, “I’ll consider it. With your addition, it will be much simpler for you to investigate with your abilities. Oh, didn’t you say that you had new discoveries?”
Jiang Baimian deliberately looked at Shang Jianyao beside her.
Shang Jianyao deliberated over his words and quickly said, “That new discovery actually involves you, Minister Xenny, so you should distance yourself from this matter.”
The faint smile on Xenny’s face revealed obvious confusion.
Shang Jianyao expressed his ‘loyalty.’ “But we trust you, Minister Xenny, just like you’ve always trusted us. We are always on the same side as you, comrades in the same trench as you.”
Xenny’s expression relaxed as she smiled and said, “Let’s talk about the new discovery first.”
“Here’s the thing. Our team’s Long Yuehong and Bai Chen previously lived together and had the same dream the same night.” Shang Jianyao first pointed out the anomaly in the matter before saying, “In that dream, they realized that Director Mei Shou’an is from the Life Ritual parish. They then tried their best to find you and report this matter to you. In the end, you were also a member of the Life Ritual parish.”
Xenny laughed involuntarily. “There’s indeed a problem with such a dream, but we can’t believe whatever others say, right?”
Shang Jianyao asked seriously, “Then, Minister Xenny, are you from the Life Ritual parish?”
“Of course not,” Xenny replied casually.
Upon seeing this, Jiang Baimian heaved a sigh of relief. This was because Shang Jianyao had secretly used Thought Guidance in his recount to make Minister Xenny treat the two of them as trustworthy companions, comrades who had risked their lives together, and members of the same small organization.
In such a situation, if Xenny was indeed from the Life Ritual parish, she would believe that Shang Jianyao and Jiang Baimian were the fellow parishioners and frankly tell the truth.
The person who created that dream’s intentions are vile… Fortunately, we didn’t act rashly. Uh, this isn’t called acting rashly but making confirmation… Jiang Baimian muttered inwardly.
“That’s good.” Shang Jianyao had a look of relief. “The Arbiter of Fate symbolizes new life, and the Life Ritual parish disregards the lives of others and randomly deprives them of life. It’s obvious that they have taken a wrong path and misread the scriptures.”
Xenny smiled and listened without commenting.
Shang Jianyao made another confirmation according to the plan. He then asked, “Minister Xenny, do you believe in the Kalendaria?”
Xenny’s gaze swept across the two of them as she replied with a smile, “I do believe in a certain Kalendaria.”
Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao tensed up. They felt the atmosphere in the deputy minister’s office freeze.
“Who?” Shang Jianyao asked with a smile.
Xenny pressed her hand to her heart and solemnly replied, “The night is long; the Arbiter of Fate blesses thee.”

Jiang Baimian’s gaze was fixed on Xenny’s face, wanting to see if she was joking. After all, if the two parties became trustworthy companions, comrades who had risked their lives together, and members of the same small organization, it was completely possible for them to prank and joke with each other.
Xenny had a solemn expression. Be it the corners of her eyes or her mouth, there was no hint of a smile.
She seemed to sincerely worship the Kalendaria, Arbiter of Fate, from the bottom of her heart.
Little Red and Little White’s dream was real… Although the information that the other faction sent us has certain errors, there’s essentially no problem… Minister Xenny is indeed a believer of the Arbiter of Fate, but she doesn’t belong to the Life Ritual parish… Mei Shou’on should be the same. Jiang Baimian’s thoughts raced as she forced herself to calm down.
Shang Jianyao’s expression didn’t change. Nobody knew if he had switched personalities.
He then curiously asked, “Minister Xenny, which Church are you from?”
“I’m not part of one.” Xenny smiled and shook her head. “Faith in the Arbiter of Fate doesn’t need a Church.”
Shang Jianyao pressed, “Then, who made you start believing in the Kalendaria, Arbiter of Fate?”
Xenny picked up the sky-blue porcelain teacup and took a sip. “Director Su.”
As expected. Although Jiang Baimian had a guess, her heart palpitated when she heard this answer.
The company had a very serious problem! A board member was a secret believer of a Kalendaria!
“Oh, oh.” Shang Jianyao came to a realization. “Apart from Director Su, do the other directors also believe in the Arbiter of Fate?”
“I’m not sure.” Xenny shook her head slightly.
Shang Jianyao then asked, “Then, what do you think of the Life Ritual parish?”
Xenny replied seriously, “They act too wantonly. I can understand their reverence for the Arbiter of Fate, but their actions were too out of line. Just like you said, they likely took a wrong path and misread the scriptures.”
Uh, it’s not that extreme. There’s still room for salvation… Jiang Baimian began to think about what to do next.
Shang Jianyao’s Thought Implantation could exist for extended periods as long as there weren’t any counterexamples or opportunities. However, it was impossible for the two of them to always follow Xenny, pay close attention to the information she received, and correct her in time.
Therefore, after the two of them left Xenny, how long would it take for her to escape the influence and discover the problem? It would be completely uncontrollable. If one was lucky, Xenny would go about her days as usual for the next few days without finding anything abnormal. If they were unlucky, Su Yu could suddenly call Xenny to discuss something—that would jolt her awake.
Due to this reason, Jiang Baimian felt that she and Shang Jianyao had to seize the opportunity to do something.
In a split second, she came up with two plans.
The first was to use Xenny’s computer and account to send this matter to all the directors in the form of an email without knowing who else was problematic on the board of directors.
The second was to think of a way to meet Big Boss at the bottom level and report this matter.
For the sake of caution, Jiang Baimian decided to carry out two plans concurrently
With Xenny temporarily in cahoots with the two of them, they could use the safe passage there to head to the lowest floor after obtaining permission to enter the management floor. At the same time, scheduling the email at a later time prevented the problematic directors from knowing that something had happened in advance and sending people to intercept the two of them at the entrance to the lowest level.
If she seized the opportunity well, sending the mass email would cause chaos. Jiang Baimian felt that it would be much easier for her and Shang Jianyao to enter the lowest levels.
Time waited for no one. Jiang Baimian acted on her thoughts.
She smiled at Xenny. “Minister, can I use your computer?”
“Sure.” Xenny didn’t think there was a problem.
Upon seeing Jiang Baimian walk to Xenny’s desk, Shang Jianyao jumped up. “I’ll help!”
He came to Jiang Baimian’s side and occupied the area, preventing Xenny from coming over to check on the situation.
Tap! Tap! Tap!
Jiang Baimian quickly typed and wrote her plan in a document so that Shang Jianyao could see it.
“Yes, yes.” Shang Jianyao nodded repeatedly with an expression of admiration.
Jiang Baimian—who didn’t know who he was acting as—deleted the plan she had just written down. She then began describing how Xenny and Su Yu were believers of Arbiter of Fate, and how Mei Shou’an was suspected of being a believer.
After that, she opened the email program, which logged into Xenny’s account by default. Following this, she created a new email with all the board directors in the send list.
After copying and pasting the content, Jiang Baimian chose to schedule to have this email sent 15 minutes later.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao had already followed the plan and further convinced Xenny not to touch the computer for half an hour and to give them permission to head to the Management Zone—the fifth floor of the underground building-and secretly seek an audience with Director Su.
Although Xenny’s office was on the 646th floor, she often had to go to the fifth floor for meetings. Furthermore, she was of sufficient rank and was Su Yu’s trusted aide. Therefore, she agreed to Shang Jianyao’s request easily. She casually found a reason and made a call to get them the corresponding permission.
After leaving her office, Jiang Baimian exhaled deeply.
She and Shang Jianyao looked at each other. Neither spoke as they walked straight to the elevator that led to the Management Zone.
On the way, Jiang Baimian habitually wanted to ask, “Do you think it’s worth it to make such a decision and take such a risk? Don’t you regret it?” However, she then remembered that Shang Jianyao was beside her. He was more radical, more adventurous, and more reckless than her.
Pangu Biology is our home. No matter what, I have to ensure its stability… Jiang Baimian said inwardly before pressing the number ‘5’ after stepping into the elevator.
As the elevator descended, Jiang Baimian—who had composed herself-laughed and said to Shang Jianyao, “Why aren’t you saying anything?”
Shang Jianyao looked up at the surveillance cameras in the elevator. “Some words aren’t suitable to be said in such a public place.”
“That’s very ambiguous,” Jiang Baimian scolded jokingly. She appeared very relaxed as if she were really going to the Management Zone to report about something work-specific with great familiarity.
After a while, the elevator arrived at the fifth floor. The elevator’s two doors opened at the same time.
After Shang Jianyao walked out, he flipped his wrist and looked at his watch. “Gosh, we’re early! We can only wait in the corridor.”
At the elevator exit, guards in bionic artificial intelligence armor looked over at the same time.
Although she couldn’t see their expressions, Jiang Baimian could vaguely sense their resistance.
“How rude!” she cooperatively cursed Shang Jianyao.
Shang Jianyao took the opportunity to sigh and said, “Then, let’s wait at the stairs to avoid being an eyesore.”
His string of words used Thought Guidance. Therefore, the guards didn’t have any doubts about him and Jiang Baimian moving to the emergency access. They felt that it was only right.
In the lit stairwell, Jiang Baimian suppressed her voice and said, “There are surveillance cameras. I’ll be in charge of pointing out the location laters. You provide the interference.”
Shang Jianyao nodded and extended his psyche.
When the email was sent on schedule, Jiang Baimian forced herself to wait patiently for three minutes so that the problem could ferment and create chaos.
As time passed, Jiang Baimian exhaled and said, “Move out!”
Without any hesitation, she nimbly walked down the stairs. From time to time, she would raise her right hand and point out the surveillance cameras’ locations to Shang Jianyao.
Shang Jianyao followed closely behind Jiang Baimian and interfered with the surveillance cameras’ images, causing them to fall into a situation as though the lights had gone out.
Such an abnormality would definitely attract the surveillance personnel’s attention, but the first thing they thought of was that there was a malfunction in the circuits. They had to send someone over to check it before they could simultaneously consider increasing the vigilance of the area.
Jiang Baimian was exploiting this time difference!
With their abilities, they had a chance of barging into Big Boss’s door as long as they didn’t encounter any high-level guards.
Thud! Thud! Thud!
Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao had outstanding physiques. They went down five flights of stairs and quickly arrived at the stairwell on the lowest floor.
Suddenly, Jiang Baimian stopped in surprise and blurted out, “There’s nobody guarding the door.”
This didn’t make sense! How could the security at the bottom—Big Boss’s residence—be so relaxed?
In the blink of an eye, Jiang Baimian had some guesses. Could it be that Big Boss has long passed away and no successor has been left behind? Could it be that the directors secretly didn’t hold a funeral and found someone good at mimicking accents to do things in her name?
“I don’t sense it either.” Shang Jianyao confirmed that Jiang Baimian’s discovery was correct.
Jiang Baimian thought for a moment and firmly said, “We’re already here. We can only advance; retreat is not an option!”
She stretched out her left hand and pushed open the stairwell door.
There was indeed nobody outside. There were no guards.
After leaving the stairwell, the two of them came to a corridor. They saw that the ground was paved with neat brown tiles. On the walls on both sides were murals, sculptures, and all kinds of decorations.
It looked very classical.
“Big Boss has good taste.” In such a tense situation, Shang Jianyao actually commented on the environment here.
Jiang Baimian glanced at him and jogged forward. She used her posture to tell Shang Jianyao: Don’t talk about trivial matters. Quickly find Big Boss’s room!
Shang Jianyao also ran, but the two of them didn’t forget to pay attention to their surroundings to prevent any possible attacks.
Under the illumination of the ceiling lamps, Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao quickly ran to the end of the corridor.
What appeared in front of them was a silver-white metal wall. In the middle of the wall was a door that slid open to the side. Beside the door was precision electronic equipment.
At this moment, the door was ajar, revealing a thick, black gap.
“Behind the door is Big Boss’s residence?” Jiang Baimian muttered to herself. She carefully approached and prepared to examine the area.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao stretched out his hand to stop her.
“What’s wrong?” Jiang Baimian thought that Shang Jianyao would run faster and more rashly than her.
Shang Jianyao replied seriously, “I find this door a little familiar. It should be the door inside Room 1215.”
1215… Jiang Baimian was stunned for a moment before she recalled that this was the first room Shang Jianyao had explored after entering the Mind Corridor.
Back then, he encountered a slightly open metal door in Room 1215. He suspected that the room owner had encountered something extremely terrifying behind the door, leaving behind a serious psychological trauma. Therefore, with a vote of eight to two, they gave up on the exploration and left.
After that, Shang Jianyao didn’t encounter Room 1215 again.
But now, he actually said that the door that was suspected of leading to Big Boss’s residence was very similar to the door in Room 1215!

All kinds of thoughts surged in Jiang Baimian’s mind before disappearing like a receding tide, leaving only a portion.
She looked at the sliding metal door in front of her and solemnly said, “1215 represents an Awakened in the Arbiter of Fate domain. What did he want to do when he came here and passed through the door?
Without waiting for Shang Jianyao’s answer, Jiang Baimian answered her question, “Either the Arbiter of Fate’s believers had designs on Big Boss and hoped to gain full control of the company, resulting in them coming up with a way to infiltrate this place. In the end, they encountered something extremely terrifying and left a psychological trauma. Otherwise, something abnormal had long happened behind the door, causing the Arbiter of Fate domain Awakened –who was loyal to the company and in charge of guarding this place-to be frightened and suffer some form of restriction.”
The Shang Jianyao that valued relationships muttered, “Can’t you be more optimistic?
“That’s not what you say every time you cook up a story for Little Red,” Jiang Baimian retorted skillfully. She then exhaled and said, “At this point, we can only advance; there’s no room for retreat.”
She had already said something similar once.
“Let me do it.” Shang Jianyao seemed to be the one offering to serve the food.
He strode toward the silver-white metal wall and the sliding door.
Jiang Baimian didn’t fight him for the honors. She slowly followed behind, raised her left arm, and prepared to deliver a high-voltage electric shock.
In a few steps, Shang Jianyao came to the door. Through the small gap, he saw a deep darkness behind the door.
Shang Jianyao didn’t hesitate; he became even more excited. He stretched out his hands, grabbed the door’s crack, and suddenly pulled it to the side.
The ajar metal door immediately emitted a grinding sound as it quickly provided passage to the interior. The light in the corridor flowed in before Shang Jianyao could enter, illuminating the area near the door.
The ground there was paved with large, milky-white square bricks. There was nothing-it looked like it was part of a spacious hall.
At this moment, Jiang Baimian suddenly said, “There are bioelectric signals inside. They are suspected to be human!”
She couldn’t sense the other party’s consciousness.
Just as Jiang Baimian said that, lamps began turning on in the area behind the metal door which wasn’t illuminated by the corridor lights.
They illuminated the large computer deep in the room and the dense screens hanging on three walls. These screens displayed Shang Jianyao and Jiang Baimian’s figures. From the moment they left the Old Task Force’s office and headed to Xenny’s place to the moment they took the elevator to the fifth floor, all the way till they came here via the stairs-their entire process was recorded.
This made Jiang Baimian tremble. She felt like her and Shang Jianyao’s actions were being watched by others quietly. There were no secrets!
Of course, this didn’t include the scenes they saw in Room 14 or their home. The process of them going down the stairs from the fifth floor to the lowest floor was also affected by the corresponding interference. The light was dim and indistinct, only revealing two figures.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao sighed and said with abnormal sincerity, “The Doctor of the Church has always been watching us.”
Jiang Baimian jolted to her senses and saw a black leather chair with armrests placed in front of the large computer.
At this moment, a man was sitting in the chair.
He looked to be in his forties. His hair was neatly combed back, and he wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. His cheeks were relatively thin, and his nose was very high. His lips were neither thick nor thin.
This man wore a white shirt, a black coat, and a dark-red tie. Even as he sat there, he gave off the feeling that he was high and above.
This was a bearing he had developed from being in a high position for a long time. It blended with his elegant bearing and had a unique charm.
Shang Jianyao and Jiang Baimian knew this man. This was because from the moment they had memories, this man would extend the new year greetings on behalf of Big Boss through the LCD screens at the Rec Center on each floor at the end of the year.
He was Ji Ze, a board member of Pangu Biology’s Board of Directors and the number one-ranking vice-president. He answered directly to Big Boss and was equivalent to the company’s Chief Executive.
He was second only to one person and above all others!
There were no guards around Ji Ze. He leaned back slightly and leaned against the leather chair before smiling at Jiang Baimian. “When you followed your father to the management’s end-of-year banquet in the past, my impression of you was that you were obedient, polite, and eloquent. I didn’t expect you to actually be so calculative. You are deep while also being firm, decisive, and fearless. As of now, nobody in the younger generation can compare to you.”
Jiang Baimian deliberately made her smile look bitter. “This is something that can’t be helped. The company is our home. We will definitely work hard to resolve any abnormalities we discover. Since time immemorial, countless people have defended their homes at the cost of their lives.”
Ji Ze nodded slightly. “Why did you suddenly choose to do this? I almost couldn’t react.”
Shang Jianyao immediately said, “Well, here’s the situation.”
Ji Ze raised his hand to stop him. “Don’t speak.”
He looked at Jiang Baimian. “You do the talking.”
Although this successfully resolved Shang Jianyao’s Thought Guidance and indicated that Ji Ze had a certain level of understanding of their abilities and knew how to avoid them, Jiang Baimian still felt inexplicably relieved.
At least this meant that Vice President Ji Ze was still relatively afraid of Shang Jianyao’s abilities!
It would be despairing if he was immune to everything.
Jiang Baimian sensed her surroundings and saw that nobody else had rushed over. Therefore, she composed herself and spoke unhurriedly from the moment they discovered that Mu Renjie had died from a myocardial infarction. She kept talking about how someone had affected Long Yuehong and Bai Chen’s dreams and how Mei Shou’an and Xenny were members of the Life Ritual parish. In order to confirm the situation, she and Shang Jianyao were willing to pay the price of being punished. They used the opportunity of reporting to Xenny to affect this Security Department deputy minister and obtained answers.
As she spoke, she observed her surroundings and thought about her current situation. She suspected that the directors had collectively sided with the Kalendaria, Arbiter of Fate, in order to seize Big Boss’s authority.
The Arbiter of Fate domain Awakened in Room 1215 was one of the people who had participated in this battle back then. He had been traumatized by Big Boss —who had gone all out.
Ji Ze quietly listened and stroked his hands. “Brave, smart, and decisive. Furthermore, you have the spirit of sacrifice. It’s no wonder you could do so much on the surface and obtain so much. Unfortunately, your efforts are destined to fail.”
Shang Jianyao had never been an obedient person who would stay silent if Ji Ze requested him to shut up. Taking the opportunity, he asked, “Are you wake?”
Wake was the most mysterious and dangerous Doctor of the Church in Pangu Biology’s Life Ritual Church.
Ji Ze was prepared to interrupt Shang Jianyao at any moment. After hearing the question, he laughed and said, “No, I’m not Wake.
“It is.” Ji Ze pointed at the large computer behind him and smiled. “You’ve been to Mechanical Paradise, so you should know about artificial intelligence. Only artificial intelligence can activate cameras 24/7 and monitor most of the company, dealing with anything the moment any abnormalities are discovered. Only such a Doctor of the Church can be said to be always watching you.” Shang Jianyao was shocked by this matter and forgot to criticize Vice President Ji for not giving artificial intelligence human rights.
He habitually and instinctively clapped. “How did it join the Life Ritual parish?” Jiang Baimian asked. The more she knew, the higher the chances of her finding an opportunity to turn the situation around.
Ji Ze smiled and said, “After the matter regarding Mu Renjie, we actually caught the Life Ritual parish’s tail. But considering how we are all believers in the Arbiter of Fate, there’s no need to make things too difficult for them. We just have to restrain their actions and prevent the extremists among them from doing anything that will ruin the company’s stability and overall situation. Therefore, I got Omega to replace the real Wake, gradually control the other Doctors of the Church, and be in charge of all aspects of the Life Ritual parish.”
Jiang Baimian’s heart slowly sank. She didn’t feel heavy because of Wake’s identity but because Ji Ze had said that they were also believers of the Arbiter of Fate without any scruples.
This reminded her of an Old World proverb: “Dead men tell no tales.”
Jiang Baimian couldn’t help but ask the question she was most concerned about. “Are all the directors believers of the Arbiter of Fate?
Ji Ze slowly nodded. He then smiled and said, “Haven’t you figured out the answer yet? I’m very disappointed.
“Why are all the directors believers of the Arbiter of Fate? Why did I just say that your efforts are destined to fail? Why did I waste my breath talking to you? The answer is very simple.”
Ji Ze stood up, pointed at a door beside the supercomputer-Omega-and said to Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao, “That’s because Big Boss’s name is: “Arbiter of Fate.”
Shang Jianyao and Jiang Baimian’s pupils instantly dilated.
Without waiting for their response, Ji Ze pressed his hand to his chest and spoke humbly and solemnly to the door. “The night is long; the Arbiter of Fate blesses thee.”

“The night is long; the Arbiter of Fate blesses thee.”
This respectful sentence echoed in Jiang Baimian’s ears, making her thoughts
erupt. However, she felt that it wasn’t impossible if that was the case.
All the abnormalities in Big Boss seemed to receive an explanation.
Ji Ze lowered his right hand and turned around. He smiled at Shang Jianyao and
Jiang Baimian. “I know you still doubt me, but didn’t you find it strange? As the
Big Boss of Pangu Biology, ‘She’ doesn’t actually lead the company’s
operations, participate in the board of directors’ various conferences, or often
appear in front of the employees. ‘She’ only speaks to everyone through the
radio at the end of the year. Won’t such a Big Boss be worried that ‘She’ will be
made a figurehead and replaced?
“Besides, normally speaking, since one is willing to do a radio speech, it’s easy
to record a video and greet all the employees through the Rec Center’s large
screens. Why is Big Boss unwilling to do so?
Jiang Baimian really didn’t understand why Big Boss had completely
relinquished power and only spoke on the radio at the end of the year. She had
even imagined many possibilities from the perspective of a conspiracy theory.
But after learning of the existence of New World powerhouses and their
condition, she no longer had any doubts. She believed that Big Boss was such a
person and that she had already entered the New World and could only return
occasionally.
There were also many reasons not to do a video call. For example, she was
dissatistied with her appearance. Therefore, she doubled dowm on genetic
enhancement research every year. Another example was that her price was an
inferiority complex, making her unwilling to meet people.
But if the premise was that Big Boss was equivalent to a Kalendaria, this would
be better explainable.
Without needing Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao to think, Ji Ze spoke on their
behalf.
“Because Big Boss is a great Kalendaria and only occasionally casts ‘Her gaze
over. I don’t know if your grandparents ever mentioned this to you. In their
era, Big Boss acted this way. Even earlier, Big Boss also didn’t appear when the
company first moved into the underground building. ‘She’ only issued orders
through the board of directors and indirectly showed strength needed to
protect most people.
“All these years, Big Boss has never changed. ‘Her voice hasn’t changed either.
Haven’t you guys noticed?”
Isn’t this because some people make the claim-whether deliberate or
unknowingly-that there’s a successor? In order to obtain the corresponding
authority and fortify their faction, ir’s relatively normal for a successor to
imitate their predecessor’s hairstyle, voice, and posture. This is mentioned in
many Old World books.. Jiang Baimian criticized inwardly.
At this moment, Shang Jianyao also said, “Director Ji, it’s not that I don’t
believe you, but you can’t just say it without evidence.”
He had already returmed to nomal and had a curious expression.
Ji Ze didn’t mind and smiled. “I understand.”
He faced the door beside the supercomputer again and respectfully said, “Thy
mercy be praised!”
Just as Ji Ze said that, the entire hall suddenly turned black.
All the lamps here were clearly lit, but they couldn’t expel the darkness at all.
Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao felt like they were being stared at bya
high-ranking existence again.
The blood in their bodies seemed to freeze instantly, and their hearts and
breaths stopped.
At this moment, the two of them seemed to hear the footsteps of death and the
great melody that extolled an eternal slumber. The memories that
unconsciously flashed through their minds were the prelude to the song.
The next second, the light returned.
Badump! Badump! Badump!
The feeling of death receded like the tide. Shang Jianyao and Jiang Baimian’s
hearts raced, almost jumping out of their throats.
With their rich experience facing a Kalendaria, it wasn’t difficult for them to
conclusion: It was indeed one of the 13 Kalendarium that had been
watching them.
Furthermore, from the strength characteristics displayed, it was none other
than the Arbiter of Fate.
Shang Jianyao raised his arms and gently rocked a baby in his arms. He
shouted without any scruples, “Newborns are likened unto the sun; life is
what’s most important!
Jiang Baimian was rendered speechless and seriously considered whether she
should do the same.
Upon seeing this, Ji Ze laughed. “Big Boss actually doesn’t like to proselytize.
She’ is more willing to interact with everyone as Pangu Biology’s protector,
company boss, and board chairwoman.
On the one hand, every Kalendaria has their own special hobbies. On the other
hand, it involves certain New World secrets. Therefore, apart from New World
powerhouses and board members, only a few people in management know this
secret for various reasons. This includes Xenny and Mei Shou’an.
“You aren’t part of management yet. According to the rules, your
rresponding memories need to be deleted; this is also your punishment.
“Well, due to your actions today being a result of the importance and love you
place toward the company, you will be exempted from any other punishment.
However, make this your last. Don’t worry; I’ll get the personnel in charge of
the operation to leave you with the memories regarding the Life Ritual parish,
as well as an impression that the company has plans toward the Arbiter of
Fate’s believers, so as to prevent this from happening again.”
This punishment is rather light.. After preliminarily confirming that Big Boss
was the Kalendaria, Arbiter of Fate, Jiang Baimian suddenly felt a little
dispirited.
Many of her previous worries had vanished.
The Life Ritual parish was just a naughty younger brother who refused to study
well and didn’t have the capital or strength. They had long been infiltrated and
was under control.
With a Kalendaria definitely present and a strength far greater than
themselves, Jiang Baimian felt that it wasn’t a bad thing to believe in the
Arbiter of Fate.
All these years, Big Boss had always been one to be hands-off. She had never
seen her make any requests of the employees.
At this thought, Jiang Baimian turned to glance at Shang Jianyao. She was more
worried about this person’s attitude.
Shang Jianyao smiled. “Alright.”
He then pressed his chest and solemnly said, “The night is long; the Arbiter of
Fate blesses thee.”
Ji Ze was rather at ease with the current situation and pointed at the lobby
door. “Go back to the stairwell. Someone will be there waiting to erase your
relevant memories.”
“Yes, Director ji.” Jiang Baimian and Shang Jianyao looked at each other and
walked out of the hall.
Behind them, the metal sliding door closed inch by inch.
The two of them walked at a moderate pace in silence. Before long, they arrived
at the emergency access entrance at the lowest level.
A man stood here. He wore a dark cap, a blue top, and black pants; his leather
shoes were brand-new and shiny.
“It’s you!” Shang Jianyao said in a tone as though he was meeting an old friend
in a foreign land. “The person who wiped away a portion of my memories back
then!
Yue Qjfan immediately felt a little embarrassed. “Those were all orders from
the Doctor of the Church. It’s the same now. Do you think I want to? I almost
died back then!”
Oh!” Shang Jianyao pointed at his leather shoes and said, “Have you saved
enough contribution points to exchange for new leather shoes?
Yue Qifan couldn’t suppress the urge to argue. “What do you mean by saving up
enough contribution points? I have a lot of contribution points. I just changed
to a more comfortable pair of old shoes for convenience.”
“Then, why didn’t you change it this time? Shang lianyao found a problem in
his answer.
Yue Qifan snorted. “The order was issued in a rush, and it’s said that there
won’t be any battles.”
Jiang Baimian interrupted their ‘conversation.’ “Let’s begin.”
Yue Qifan nodded, and his dark-brown eyes turned pure black.
On the 640oth floor, in the Order Supervisory Bureau that managed the 20
floors above and below.
Long Yuehong and Bai Chen took their electronic photos and filled in the
application form and personal information forms. Finally, they heard the staff
at the window say, “After you sign your names, the registration is complete.
There’s no actual marriage certificate, but the corresponding information on
your electronic card will be modified to ‘Married.’ You will be assigned a new
room in a week.”
Bai Chen and Long Yuehong glanced at each other, picked up a pen beside
them, and signed their names on the document handed over by the staf.
After completing this step, Long Yuehong mimicked some of the Old World’s
entertainment and spread his arms to Bai Chen. “Happy marriage.”
“Happy marriage.” Bai Chen returned the hug.
On the 647th floor, Room 14.
Jiang Baimian rubbed her head and returned to her seat as team leader. She
sighed with emotion. “We can never underestimate a large faction like the
company that has been running for decades. The problem has long been
resolved.”
Shang Jianyao nodded. “That’s right, that’s right.”
He then leaned back in his chair and massaged his temples. Soon, his figure
appeared in the Sea of Origins.
Shang ianyao quickly split into nine and cast his gaze at the rift that
represented Xiaochong in midair, one that had fused with some white aura.
A figure crawled out-it was another Shang Jianyao.
He looked down at his peers and calmly said, “As long as I don’t completely
crawl over, there’s no danger. Even if I crawl over, it shouldn’t be a problem
since it’s Xiaochong over there.”
“Why did you do that? the ruthless sShang lianyao asked in hatred and disgust.
The other Shang lianyao replied seriously, “I can’t accept the fact that the
company has to tolerate the Life Ritual parish just because everyone is a
believer of the Arbiter of Fate. Uncle Shen and the others won’t die in vain. Ill
never forget it!”
“So you took the risk of implicating everyone and hid in Xiaochong’s rift with
the copied memories?” the ruthless Shang lianyao asked sharply. “Is this your
justice, your abhorrence of evil?
The Shang lianyao frankly admitted, “Yes.”
“Alright, stop arguing. Nothing happened anyway.” “The calm and rational
Shang Jianyao stroked his chin and said, “This matter happened to give me
inspiration–inspiration to clear Room 506’s third psychological trauma.”
The Shang Jianyaos combined into one again and left their room to enter 506.
He skillfully pretended to clear the obstacles and create an explosion before
facing the cold, stiff, and seemingly dead faces.
Shang Jianyao didn’t persuade them; he didn’t attempt to change the attitude
of the people in the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area. Instead, he sat
down cross-legged.
He frankly said, “There’s nothing wrong with my choice; such an outcome is
inevitable. I just didn’t expect it to be so bad. I don’t pray for everyone to accept
me again. I only plan on chanting sutras to send you off.”
He composed himself and got Zen Master Redemption to take over his body.
Zen Master Redemption looked at the corpse-ike humans, sighed, and
chanted a Buddhist proclamation. “Namo Annutara-Samyak-Subhuti.
As the Buddhist proclamations sounded, the people’s expressions gradually
softened as their eyes slowly closed.
They fell to the ground one after another, and black gas on them seemed to
dissipate.
Toward the end, the Fourth Research Institute’s residential area began to
collapse and fall into an endless darkness.
*
Shang Jianyao opened his eyes and took the small speaker with a blue bottom
and a black surface. He stroked it for a while before a smile slowly appeared on
his face.
At this moment, Long Yuehong and Bai Chen returned to the office.
“Done w
